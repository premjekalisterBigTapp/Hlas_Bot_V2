  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address injuries arising from participation in naval, military, air force, civil defence, or police services or operations, and are these activities covered or excluded under the general injury exclusions?",
    "In what ways does the exclusion of injuries caused by testing of conveyances or employment as a manual worker in off-shore, mining, aerial photography, or handling explosives impact coverage for accidents occurring during these activities?",
    "How are injuries resulting from suicide, attempted suicide, self-injury, or willful exposure to peril treated under the policy, and are there any exceptions such as attempts to save human life?",
    "What are the implications of excluding injuries related to pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, or childbirth on claims for medical expenses or disability arising from these conditions?",
    "How does the policy exclude coverage for injuries caused by infectious diseases, venereal diseases, HIV/AIDS, and their mutant derivatives, and what documentation or proof might be required to substantiate such exclusions?",
    "In cases where mental, nervous, or sleep disorders including diagnosed psychological or psychiatric conditions such as anxiety or depression cause injury, how does the exclusion affect claim eligibility?",
    "How does the policy define and apply the exclusion for any pre-existing medical conditions or pre-existing physical or mental defects or infirmities in relation to injury claims?",
    "If an insured person is injured while engaged in military or police operations but the injury is unrelated to the operation itself, does the exclusion still apply, and how is this distinction handled?",
    "How does the exclusion for injuries caused by handling explosives, ammunitions, or firearms interact with claims arising from accidental discharge or mishandling during non-professional activities?",
    "What are the coverage implications if an injury occurs during aerial photography work, considering the policy’s exclusion for this activity, and are there any exceptions for hobbyist versus professional work?",
    "How does the policy treat injuries caused by self-inflicted harm when the intent was to save another person’s life, and what evidence is required to prove such intent?",
    "Are injuries related to pregnancy complications covered if they result from an accident unrelated to pregnancy itself, given the exclusion for pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, or childbirth?",
    "How does the exclusion of infectious diseases and HIV-related illnesses affect claims for injuries sustained due to secondary infections contracted during travel?",
    "In the context of mental and nervous disorders exclusions, how are claims handled if the injury is physical but caused indirectly by a diagnosed psychiatric disorder?",
    "What documentation or medical evidence is necessary to establish that an injury is due to a pre-existing medical condition and therefore excluded from coverage?",
    "How does the policy exclusion for injuries during testing of conveyances apply to insured persons who are passengers rather than operators during such tests?",
    "If an insured person suffers an injury while employed as a manual worker in mining but the injury occurs off-site, does the exclusion still apply, and how is the location of injury determined?",
    "How are injuries caused by venereal diseases or their complications treated under the policy, and what are the implications for claims involving sexually transmitted infections?",
    "Does the exclusion for mental and nervous disorders extend to temporary conditions such as acute stress reactions, and how is the duration or diagnosis of such conditions evaluated for claims?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between pre-existing physical infirmities and new injuries arising from the same body part, and what criteria are used to determine coverage eligibility?"
