  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address claims arising from negligence or willful acts by the insured or their immediate family members, and what documentation is required to prove such acts?",
    "In what ways do criminal or fraudulent acts committed by the insured or authorized individuals with access to the property affect coverage eligibility and claim settlements?",
    "How are losses caused by radioactive contamination from nuclear fuel or nuclear waste treated under the policy, and what exclusions apply to consequential losses or legal liabilities arising from such contamination?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if damage results from radioactive, toxic, or explosive properties of nuclear assemblies or components, and how does this interact with general exclusions for hazardous materials?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between losses caused by negligence of the insured versus negligence of authorized third parties such as domestic workers or tenants, and what proof is necessary to establish liability?",
    "Under what circumstances would losses due to radioactive contamination be excluded even if the contamination is indirect or consequential, and how does this exclusion affect claims for property damage versus personal injury?",
    "What is the scope of exclusion related to willful acts by the insured’s legal representatives or employees, and how does this exclusion apply if the act was unauthorized or unknown to the insured?",
    "How does the policy handle claims involving losses from sonic bangs, and are there any specific conditions or documentation requirements that must be met for such claims to be considered?",
    "In cases where radioactive contamination results from nuclear weapons or materials, how does the policy exclude coverage for both direct and indirect damages, and what are the implications for insured property?",
    "How are losses resulting from negligence or fraudulent acts by housemates or room-mates who have authorized access to the property treated under the policy, especially in shared living situations?",
    "What are the differences in coverage exclusions between losses caused by radioactive contamination from nuclear fuel combustion versus contamination from nuclear waste, and how should claims be documented accordingly?",
    "How does the policy define and apply the exclusion for losses caused by the hazardous properties of explosive nuclear components, and what impact does this have on claims involving legal liability?",
    "In the event of a loss caused by negligence of an employer or employee with authorized access to the insured property, how does the policy determine responsibility and coverage limits?",
    "How does the exclusion for negligence or willful acts interact with other policy provisions when the act is committed by a domestic worker, and what evidence is required to deny or approve a claim?",
    "What are the policy’s requirements for proving that a loss was not caused by radioactive contamination or sonic bangs in order to qualify for coverage, and how does this affect claim investigations?",
    "How does the policy address the potential overlap between losses caused by negligence and those caused by radioactive contamination, and which exclusion takes precedence in such cases?",
    "What documentation and timing considerations are necessary when claiming losses related to sonic bangs, and are there any specific exclusions or limits that apply to such claims?",
    "How does the policy treat losses arising from negligence or fraudulent acts committed by authorized tenants, and what are the implications for shared property insurance claims?",
    "In what ways do the exclusions for radioactive contamination and negligence affect coverage for consequential losses, and how are these differentiated in claim assessments?",
