    "What is the relationship between the definitions of 'Unoccupied' and 'Uninhabitable' in determining whether the Home is eligible for coverage under Section 1, and can both conditions apply simultaneously?",
    "How are items classified as 'Valuables' distinguished from general Household Contents in terms of claim processing, valuation, and any applicable sub-limits within Section 1?",
    "What impact does the Waiting Period have on newly added Renovations or Fixtures, and are these items covered immediately after installation or subject to the same 90-day restriction?",
