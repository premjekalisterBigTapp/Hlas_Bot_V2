  "questions": [
    "How does the policy determine the percentage of benefit payable for total loss by physical severance versus total and permanent loss of use of varying numbers of phalanges on the index finger?",
    "In the event of losing two phalanges of the middle finger, what percentage of benefit is payable and how does this compare to losing two phalanges of the index finger?",
    "What documentation or medical evidence might be required to prove total and permanent loss of use of one phalanx of the index finger to claim the 5% benefit?",
    "If an insured suffers total loss of three phalanges of the middle finger, how does the policy quantify the benefit percentage and does it differ from the index finger's three phalanges loss?",
    "How are partial losses, such as the loss of one phalanx versus two phalanges on the same finger, differentiated in terms of benefit percentages for both the index and middle fingers?",
    "Does the policy specify whether the loss must be physical severance or can total and permanent loss of use alone qualify for the stated percentage benefits for finger phalanges?",
    "In a scenario where an insured loses one phalanx of the middle finger and one phalanx of the index finger, how would the benefits be calculated and combined?",
    "Are there any conditions or exclusions related to the cause of the loss of finger phalanges that might affect eligibility for the stated percentage benefits?",
    "How does the policy address the loss of phalanges on fingers other than the index and middle fingers, given the percentages specified only for these two fingers?",
    "What is the rationale for the difference in percentage benefits between the index finger and middle finger for the same number of phalanges lost?",
    "If the loss of use is temporary but expected to become permanent, how does the policy treat the timing of the claim for the percentage benefits related to finger phalanges?",
    "Are there any limits or caps on the total benefit payable if multiple fingers suffer total loss of phalanges, such as both index and middle fingers?",
    "How does the policy define 'total and permanent loss of use' of a phalanx, and what medical assessments are required to confirm this condition for claims?",
    "In cases of partial severance or injury that does not result in total loss of use, how does the policy handle benefit percentages for finger phalanges?",
    "Does the policy provide any guidance on how to apportion benefits if the insured loses phalanges on both hands or multiple fingers simultaneously?",
    "Are there any waiting periods or time limits within which the insured must report the loss of finger phalanges to qualify for the percentage benefits?",
    "How does the policy interact with general exclusions or other sections if the loss of finger phalanges results from a pre-existing condition or an excluded peril?",
    "What procedures must the insured follow to prove the physical severance of phalanges, and how does this affect the claim process for the specified percentage benefits?",
    "If the insured suffers total loss of use without physical severance due to nerve damage, does the policy treat this the same as physical severance for benefit calculation?",
    "How are benefits calculated if the insured loses phalanges on the index finger and middle finger on the same hand, considering the different percentage benefits for each finger?"
