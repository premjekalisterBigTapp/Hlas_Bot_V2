  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define the maximum coverage for accidental loss or damage to household contents during a contractor-led interior decoration or refurbishment period, and what is the maximum allowable duration for such coverage?",
    "In what circumstances can the Benefit Limit be automatically reinstated after a claim under this section, and what condition must be met regarding premium payment for this reinstatement?",
    "What are the eligibility criteria and coverage limits for the Emergency Cash Allowance when a home is deemed uninhabitable due to insured perils, and what types of expenses are covered under this allowance?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for household contents loss or damage if the interior decoration or refurbishment period exceeds sixty days, and are such claims excluded or limited?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to verify that the home was uninhabitable for at least three days to qualify for the Emergency Cash Allowance?",
    "If a claim is made for accidental loss during refurbishment and the Benefit Limit is reinstated, how does the additional premium payment affect subsequent claims within the same policy period?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations related to the types of contractors or refurbishment work that qualify for the 30% Benefit Limit coverage during decoration periods?",
    "How does the Emergency Cash Allowance interact with other sections of the policy that cover personal effects or clothing, and is there any overlap or coordination of benefits?",
    "If multiple claims occur during a single refurbishment period, how is the 30% Benefit Limit applied—per claim or as an aggregate limit for the entire period?",
    "What happens to the coverage for household contents if the refurbishment work is interrupted or extended beyond the 60-day limit, and does the policy provide any grace period or automatic extensions?",
    "In the event of a claim for emergency cash allowance, does the policy require itemized receipts or proof of purchase for essential items, and what happens if such documentation is not provided?",
    "How does the policy define 'Uninhabitable' in the context of triggering the Emergency Cash Allowance, and are there any exclusions for certain types of damage or perils?",
    "Is the automatic reinstatement of the Benefit Limit available for all types of claims under this section, or are there specific claim types or perils that are excluded from reinstatement?",
    "How does the policy address situations where accidental loss or damage occurs both during and outside the interior decoration period—are different limits or conditions applied?",
    "Are there any general policy exclusions that override the coverage provided for accidental loss during refurbishment or the Emergency Cash Allowance, such as damage due to wear and tear or intentional acts?",
    "If the home is uninhabitable due to a peril not covered under the insured perils, is the Emergency Cash Allowance still payable, or is this considered a section-specific exclusion?",
    "Does the policy specify any waiting periods or notification requirements before the Emergency Cash Allowance can be claimed following the home being declared uninhabitable?",
    "How does the policy handle claims where the accidental loss or damage during refurbishment involves items that are part of a pair or set—does the 30% Benefit Limit apply differently in such cases?",
    "In the event of a claim under this section, how are payments coordinated if the insured has other insurance policies covering household contents or emergency expenses?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the insured fails to pay the additional premium required for automatic reinstatement after a claim under this section?"
