    "When a claimant suffers total and permanent loss of use of fingers without physical severance, how does the policy apply the Percentage of Benefit, and what conditions must be met to qualify for this benefit?",
    "How does the policy address the calculation of benefits when multiple losses occur simultaneously, such as loss of hearing in one ear and loss of fingers, and are benefits cumulative or subject to limits?",
    "What are the requirements for establishing 'total and permanent loss of use' for the thumb and fingers, and how does this affect the timing and approval of claims under this section?",
    "In the event of partial loss or injury to fingers that does not meet the criteria for total loss of phalanges, how does the policy handle benefit percentages, and are there provisions for partial compensation?",

    "What is the impact on the Percentage of Benefit if the loss of fingers or thumb occurs on the non-dominant hand, and does the policy differentiate benefits based on hand dominance or functionality?",
    "How are claims managed if the insured experiences progressive loss of use over time rather than immediate total loss, and what are the implications for benefit percentages and claim timing?",
    "Does the policy provide any guidance on the interaction between this section's benefits and general policy exclusions such as injuries sustained during high-risk activities or due to non-compliance with safety regulations?",
    "In the event of multiple partial losses across different fingers or phalanges, how does the policy aggregate the Percentage of Benefit, and are there maximum limits to combined claims under this section?",
