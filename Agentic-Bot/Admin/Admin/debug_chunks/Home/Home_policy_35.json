  "content": "#### Section 4. Deterioration of Frozen Food\nWe will pay up to $1,000 for the cost of replacing deteriorated or putrid frozen food in Your deep freezer or freezer section of Your refrigerator at Your Home, provided that the freezer or refrigerator is less than five (5) years old and the frozen food is damaged by failure of the freezer.\n\nWe will not pay for\na. Loss or damage caused by the deliberate act of You.\nb. Loss or damage caused by failure of the supply of electricity occasioned by the deliberate act of any electricity authority / supplier or by the exercise of such authority / supplier of its power to withhold or restrict supply.\nc. Loss or damage occurring while Your Home remains unoccupied for more than sixty (60) consecutive days\nd. Consequential loss of any kind.",
  "questions": [
    "What conditions must be met regarding the age of the freezer and the location of the frozen food for deterioration coverage to apply, and how does this interact with exclusions related to deliberate acts or power supply failures?",
    "How does the policy define and limit coverage for deterioration of frozen food due to freezer failure, and what documentation or proof might be required to substantiate a claim under this section?",
    "In what scenarios would deterioration of frozen food caused by an electricity supply failure be excluded from coverage, particularly considering deliberate acts by the electricity supplier or authority?",
    "How does the policy address claims for frozen food deterioration if the insured home has been unoccupied for more than 60 consecutive days, and what implications does this have for seasonal or secondary residences?",
    "What is the maximum amount payable for frozen food deterioration, and how does this limit interact with any general policy limits or other section-specific limits?",
    "How does the exclusion of consequential loss affect claims for frozen food deterioration, especially in cases where the freezer failure leads to additional damages or losses?",
    "If the deterioration of frozen food occurs in a freezer older than five years, how does this affect claim eligibility, and are there any exceptions or considerations for older appliances?",
    "How would a deliberate act by the insured that causes freezer failure or frozen food deterioration impact the claim, and how is 'deliberate act' interpreted within this context?",
    "In cases where the electricity supply failure is due to a power outage not caused by a deliberate act or exercise of power by the supplier, would deterioration of frozen food be covered, and what evidence would be needed?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between deterioration caused by freezer failure and deterioration caused by other factors such as power outages or mechanical faults, and how do exclusions apply accordingly?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the frozen food is stored in a freezer section of a refrigerator that is exactly five years old, and how is the age of the appliance verified?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for frozen food deterioration if the freezer failure occurs during a period when the home is intermittently occupied but exceeds 60 consecutive days of vacancy at some point?",
    "Are there any interactions between this section's exclusions and the policy-wide general exclusions, particularly regarding intentional acts or failure of utilities?",
    "How does the policy address the replacement cost of frozen food—does it cover actual purchase price, market value, or another valuation method, and are receipts or proof of purchase required?",
    "If the deterioration of frozen food results from a freezer malfunction that is not immediately apparent, how does the timing of discovery affect claim eligibility under this section?",
    "How would claims be handled if the frozen food deterioration is partially due to freezer failure and partially due to a power outage caused by a non-deliberate act of the electricity supplier?",
    "What documentation or evidence is typically required to prove that the freezer or refrigerator is less than five years old and that the deterioration was caused by freezer failure?",
    "How does the policy define 'failure of the freezer,' and are routine maintenance issues or gradual loss of freezing capacity covered or excluded?",
    "In the event of a claim, how does the policy address situations where the frozen food is stored in multiple freezers or refrigerators at the insured home, some of which may be older than five years?",
    "How does the exclusion for loss or damage caused by deliberate acts by the insured interact with potential fraudulent claims related to frozen food deterioration?"
