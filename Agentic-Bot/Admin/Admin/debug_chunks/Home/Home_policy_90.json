  "content": "(b) the radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties of any explosive nuclear assembly or nuclear component thereof.\n6.  **Sonic Bangs**\n    Loss or damage resulting from pressure waves caused by aircraft or other aerial devices travelling at sonic or supersonic speeds.\n7.  **Property Damage Clarification Clause**\n    Property damage covered under this Policy shall mean physical damage to the substance of property. Physical damage to the substance of property shall not include damage to the data or software, in particular any detrimental change in data, software or computer programs that is caused by deletion, a corruption or a deformation of the original structure.\n    Consequently the following are excluded from this Policy:-",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address loss or damage caused by radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of nuclear assemblies, and how does this general exclusion interact with claims involving nuclear contamination during travel?",
    "In what scenarios would loss or damage resulting from sonic bangs caused by aircraft or aerial devices traveling at supersonic speeds be excluded, and how does this exclusion affect claims for property damage during air travel?",
    "How does the Property Damage Clarification Clause define covered property damage, and what are the implications for claims involving damage to data or software on electronic devices during a trip?",
    "If a traveler's electronic device suffers a detrimental change in data or software due to corruption or deletion, how does the policy's exclusion of such damage impact the claim, and what documentation would be required to substantiate the nature of the damage?",
    "How do the exclusions related to nuclear components and sonic bangs interact with other general exclusions in the policy when a claim involves multiple causes of damage, such as an aircraft incident involving radioactive materials?",
    "What types of physical property damage are covered under the policy, and how does the exclusion of data or software damage affect claims for loss of digital content or programs during travel?",
    "In cases where property damage involves both physical damage to the substance of the property and damage to embedded software, how does the policy determine coverage eligibility, and what evidence is necessary to differentiate between the two?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for damage caused by pressure waves from supersonic aircraft when the damage occurs to personal belongings during air travel, and are there any exceptions to this exclusion?",
    "What is the significance of excluding damage to data or software from coverage, and how might this exclusion affect claims for loss of digital travel documents or electronic tickets?",
    "How does the policy define 'physical damage to the substance of property,' and how does this definition influence the assessment of claims involving complex electronic devices with both hardware and software components?",
    "In the event of a loss involving an explosive nuclear assembly or component, what documentation and proof would be required to demonstrate that the damage falls under the policy's nuclear exclusion?",
    "How does the exclusion of sonic bang-related damage apply to claims involving hearing loss or personal injury, and does this exclusion extend beyond property damage to other sections of the policy?",
    "When a claim involves damage caused by a combination of software corruption and physical impact, how does the policy allocate coverage or exclusions, and what are the implications for partial claims?",
    "Are there any circumstances under which damage caused by pressure waves from supersonic aircraft could be considered covered, such as indirect damage or consequential losses, according to the policy language?",
    "How does the policy's exclusion of damage to data or software interact with claims for loss of photos, videos, or other personal digital content stored on devices damaged during travel?",
    "What are the policy's requirements for proving that property damage is physical and not related to software or data corruption, and how might this affect claims involving modern electronic devices?",
    "How does the policy address the risk of damage from hazardous nuclear components during travel to areas with known nuclear activity, and what exclusions would apply in such cases?",
    "In the context of the Property Damage Clarification Clause, how are claims handled when the insured property is a computer system that suffers both hardware failure and software corruption during a trip?",
    "What is the impact of the nuclear and sonic bang exclusions on coverage for travel to or from military zones or areas with active aerial supersonic operations?",
    "How do these specific exclusions (nuclear hazards, sonic bangs, data/software damage) align with or override any general policy exclusions related to war, terrorism, or technological failures?"
