  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address losses caused by government authorities such as confiscation or requisition, and how do these exclusions interact with claims arising from civil commotion or riots?",
    "In what ways are losses resulting from war risks, including declared or undeclared wars, civil wars, and military uprisings, excluded from coverage under this policy, and how might this affect claims during politically unstable travel destinations?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a loss occurs due to an act of terrorism, and how does this general exclusion differ from exclusions related to war risks or civil commotion?",
    "If a traveler’s property is confiscated by local municipal authorities during their trip, how does the policy’s exclusion for acts of authorities impact the possibility of reimbursement?",
    "How does the exclusion of war risks apply to scenarios involving mutiny or rebellion on a cruise ship, and what documentation would be necessary to support or deny a claim in such cases?",
    "When a loss is caused by a riot or civil commotion that escalates to an uprising, how does the policy determine whether the event falls under the war risks exclusion or remains potentially covered?",
    "How are losses caused by martial law or a state of siege treated under the policy, and what challenges might arise in proving whether such conditions existed at the time of the loss?",
    "If an insured experiences damage due to a conspiracy or military usurpation during their trip, how does the general exclusion for war risks affect their claim eligibility?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between losses caused by acts of terrorism and those caused by civil commotion or riots, and what are the coverage implications for each?",
    "In cases where a loss results from requisition by government authorities during a declared state of emergency, how does the acts of authorities exclusion interact with the war risks exclusion?",
    "What are the potential coverage consequences if a traveler’s belongings are commandeered by a local authority during a military uprising, considering both the acts of authorities and war risks exclusions?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for losses arising from popular rising or insurrection, and what evidence would be required to determine if these events fall under the war risks exclusion?",
    "If a loss occurs due to nationalisation of property by a foreign government during travel, how does the acts of authorities exclusion apply, and are there any exceptions?",
    "How do the exclusions for war risks and acts of terrorism apply if a loss occurs during a civil war that includes terrorist activities, and how might this affect claim processing?",
    "In what scenarios would losses caused by martial law or a state of siege be covered or excluded, and how does the policy define these conditions for claim assessment?",
    "How does the policy address losses resulting from military or popular rising when such events are not officially declared as war, and what documentation is necessary to support a claim?",
    "If a traveler’s property is damaged during a riot that does not escalate to a civil war or uprising, how does the war risks exclusion apply, and what other exclusions might be relevant?",
    "How does the policy’s exclusion for any act of terrorism interact with general exclusions related to war risks and acts of authorities when multiple causes contribute to a loss?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a loss is caused by a state of siege imposed by a local authority, and how does this relate to the exclusions for acts of authorities and war risks?",
    "How does the policy treat losses resulting from confiscation or commandeering by authorities during a military or popular uprising, considering the overlap between acts of authorities and war risks exclusions?"
