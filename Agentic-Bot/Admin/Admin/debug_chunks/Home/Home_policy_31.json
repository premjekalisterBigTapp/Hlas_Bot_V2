  "content": "##### Claim Settlement applicable to Section 1:\nWe will pay the cost of replacement as new (or We will replace as new at Our option) except for:\na. Towels, curtains, bed and table linen, carpets, shoes, handbags and clothing where a deductible for wear and tear will be made after assessment of the same by Us and/or its authorized representatives.\nb. Items that can be economically repaired (including but not limited to household linen and clothing) where the cost of the repair will be paid.\n\nIf at the time of any loss or damage the total cost of replacing all the Household Contents as new less an allowance for wear and tear on towels, curtains, shoes, handbags, clothing, carpets and linen (replacement cost) is greater than the Benefit Limit on Household Contents, We will pay only that proportion of the loss which the Benefit Limit on Household Contents bears to the replacement cost.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy determine the settlement amount for damaged household contents when the total replacement cost exceeds the Benefit Limit, and how is the proportional payment calculated?",
    "In what scenarios will the insurer opt to repair items instead of replacing them, and how does this affect the claim settlement for household linen and clothing?",
    "What types of household items are subject to a deductible for wear and tear, and how is this deductible assessed by the insurer or its representatives?",
    "How does the policy treat the replacement cost for towels, curtains, shoes, handbags, clothing, carpets, and linen differently from other household contents in terms of wear and tear deductions?",
    "If a claim involves both repairable and non-repairable household items, how does the insurer determine the settlement amounts for each category under Section 1?",
    "What documentation or assessment process might the insurer require to evaluate wear and tear on specific household items before settling a claim?",
    "How does the policy handle the replacement cost calculation when only a portion of the household contents is lost or damaged, especially regarding the proportional payment relative to the Benefit Limit?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations on the types of household contents covered under Section 1 that affect the claim settlement process for replacement or repair?",
    "How does the insurer's option to replace items as new versus paying the cost of replacement impact the timing and method of claim settlement?",
    "In cases where the household contents include items with varying degrees of wear and tear, how does the insurer apply the deductible across multiple items within the same claim?",
    "What is the impact of the deductible for wear and tear on the overall claim amount when towels, curtains, or clothing are involved in a loss?",
    "How does the policy define 'replacement cost' for household contents, and how does this definition influence the calculation of proportional payments when limits are exceeded?",
    "If the Benefit Limit on Household Contents is less than the replacement cost after wear and tear allowances, how does this affect the insured's out-of-pocket expenses?",
    "How does the insurer assess whether an item can be economically repaired, and what criteria determine whether repair costs or replacement costs are paid?",
    "What happens if the cost to repair an item exceeds its replacement cost—does the policy then pay for replacement instead of repair?",
    "How are items like carpets and linen treated differently from other household contents in terms of wear and tear deductions and claim settlement?",
    "Does the policy provide any guidance on how to handle claims involving mixed losses of items eligible for replacement as new and those subject to wear and tear deductions?",
    "How does the insurer's authorized representative's assessment influence the final claim settlement amount for household contents under Section 1?",
    "In the event of partial damage to household contents, how does the policy calculate the deductible for wear and tear and apply it to the claim amount?",
    "Are there any conditions under which the insurer might refuse to pay the full replacement cost even if the Benefit Limit is not exceeded, based on the wear and tear assessment?"
