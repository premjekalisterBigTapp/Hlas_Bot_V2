  "content": "\"Valuables\" under Section 1 of this Policy shall mean curios, pictures or other work of art, furs, jewellery, jades, gemstones, watches, gold or silver objects, antiques and the like.\n\nValuables are subject to a limit of indemnity in the sum of $2,500 for any one article and $5,000 in the aggregate for any one loss.\n\nThe following limits will apply in respect of loss or damage to bicycles, computers, audio/video equipment, musical instruments and camera equipment:\n* For any one article Up to 3% of the total Benefit Limit under Section 1 unless specified in the Policy.\n* For any one claim Up to one third of the total Benefit Limit under Section 1 unless specified in the Policy.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define 'Valuables' under Section 1, and what are the specific per-article and aggregate limits of indemnity for these items in the event of loss or damage?",
    "In the case of a claim involving a single valuable item such as a piece of jewellery, how does the $2,500 per-article limit interact with the $5,000 aggregate limit for multiple valuables lost in the same incident?",
    "What are the indemnity limits for loss or damage to bicycles, and how do these limits compare to those for other specified items like computers and musical instruments under Section 1?",
    "How is the limit of 'up to 3% of the total Benefit Limit under Section 1' applied to individual articles such as camera equipment, and what documentation might be required to substantiate the value of such items?",
    "When multiple articles such as audio/video equipment and musical instruments are lost in a single claim, how does the 'up to one third of the total Benefit Limit under Section 1' cap affect the total payout?",
    "If a claim involves both valuables (e.g., jewellery) and bicycles, how are the different limits of indemnity applied, and can the aggregate limits for valuables and the percentage limits for bicycles be combined or do they apply separately?",
    "Are antiques and other art objects covered under the same per-article and aggregate limits as jewellery and watches, and how might their valuation affect claim settlement?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for loss or damage to multiple bicycles or multiple computers in a single incident, considering the per-article and per-claim limits specified?",
    "In the event of partial damage to a valuable item such as a watch or gemstone, how would the limit of indemnity apply, and does the policy specify any conditions on repair versus replacement costs?",
    "What happens if the value of a single valuable item exceeds the $2,500 per-article limit, and are there options for additional coverage or endorsements to increase this limit?",
    "How do the limits for bicycles, computers, and similar items interact with any general policy exclusions or conditions that might affect claims for loss or damage to personal property?",
    "If a claim involves loss of a set of valuables (e.g., matching jewellery pieces), how does the policy's pair-and-sets clause apply in relation to the $2,500 per-article and $5,000 aggregate limits?",
    "Are there any specific exclusions or conditions in Section 1 that would override the stated limits for valuables or specified equipment, such as exclusions for unattended property or theft without police reports?",
    "How does the policy define the 'total Benefit Limit under Section 1,' and how does this figure influence the calculation of the 3% per-article and one third per-claim limits for bicycles and electronic equipment?",
    "In cases where the policyholder owns multiple types of covered equipment (e.g., a bicycle and a musical instrument), how are the individual item limits and overall claim limits coordinated to determine the maximum indemnity?",
    "What documentation or proof of ownership is typically required to support claims for valuables and specified equipment, and how might this affect the timing and success of a claim?",
    "Does the policy provide any automatic extensions or exceptions to the stated limits for valuables or specified equipment in cases of total loss, theft with police report, or other covered events?",
    "How are claims handled if the loss or damage to valuables or specified equipment occurs during a covered trip but the items were not declared or insured separately, considering the stated limits?",
    "Are there any age or usage-related conditions that affect the applicability of the limits for bicycles, computers, or musical instruments, such as exclusions for commercial use or items owned by minors?",
    "How do the limits for valuables and specified equipment interact with any general policy-wide exclusions related to war, confiscation, or wear and tear, and which exclusions take precedence in a claim?"
