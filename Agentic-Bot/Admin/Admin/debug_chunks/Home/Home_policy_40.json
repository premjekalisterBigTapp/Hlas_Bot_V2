    "In the event of a liability claim involving multiple types of excluded vehicles (e.g., a power-driven watercraft and an aircraft), how does the policy apply its exclusions and excess?",
    "How might the policy exclusions related to vibration, subsidence, and earth movement interact with general exclusions for natural disasters or environmental hazards?",
