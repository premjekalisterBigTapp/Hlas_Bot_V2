In the event that You are covered under more than one such policy, We will consider You to be insured under the policy first issued and We will refund any duplicate insurance premium payment, which may have been made by or on behalf of You.\n8.  **Due Observance**\n    The conditions that appear in the Policy or in any Endorsements are part of the contract and must be complied with. The due observance and compliance of these conditions by You and the truth of the statements and answers in the proposal form shall be conditions precedent to any liability of Us to make any payment under this Policy.\n9.  **Duty of Care**\n    You must take all reasonable steps to prevent injury, loss or damage to the Home which may give rise to a claim under this Policy and to maintain such insured property in a proper condition.\n10. **Free Look Period**",
