  "content": "We will not pay for the cost of replacing or repairing any undamaged part of the Household Contents which forms part of a suite or part of a common design or function when the damage is restricted to a clearly definable area or to a specific part thereof.\n\nThe maximum amount payable in respect of any one claim under any paragraph of Section 1 is the Benefit Limit (less any amount deducted) subject to any limit shown in the Policy Schedule.",
