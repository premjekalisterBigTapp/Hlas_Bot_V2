  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define coverage for injuries sustained during air travel, and what are the conditions under which flying-related injuries are excluded or included?",

    "How does the policy distinguish between injuries caused by recreational flying versus commercial air travel, and what impact does this have on coverage eligibility?",
    "In cases where an insured engages in aerial activities not involving a commercial airline, such as private or charter flights, how does this exclusion affect claim outcomes?",

    "If an insured person is injured during a commercial airline flight but not as a fare-paying passenger (e.g., as staff or a non-paying guest), how does this clause affect coverage?",
    "How does the policy handle injuries sustained during aerial activities that are part of a travel itinerary but not on licensed commercial airlines, such as sightseeing flights or air taxis?",
    "In what ways does the exclusion of injuries from trade or technical activities connected with aircraft or vessels impact insured persons involved in maintenance or support roles?",
    "How does the policy define 'properly licensed, regular scheduled commercial airline,' and what are the coverage implications if an airline does not meet these criteria?",
    "If an insured person is injured while motorcycling but wearing protective gear and following safety regulations, does this exclusion still apply, and how might this affect claim evaluation?",
