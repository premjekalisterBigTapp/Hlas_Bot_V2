    "How does the exclusion of stamp and coin collections interact with any optional covers or endorsements that might be available for collectibles?",
    "What are the implications of the Valuables section exclusions on claims involving lost or stolen items that are not explicitly listed but could be considered similar in nature?",
    "How does the policy define 'more specifically insured' in the context of the exclusion for property insured under other policies, and how does this affect claim adjudication?",
