  "questions": [
    "How does the automatic termination of the policy interact with the insured's change in residency status, such as ceasing to be a Singapore Citizen or losing a valid employment pass, and what documentation is required to prove such status changes?",
    "In what scenarios would the policy automatically terminate due to the insured's age, and how does this age-based termination affect claims made shortly before or after the insured turns sixty-six?",
    "If the insured passes away, how does the automatic termination clause affect ongoing claims or benefits, and what proof of death is necessary to process such claims?",
    "How does the policy handle automatic termination if the insured is absent from Singapore for more than 183 consecutive days, and what evidence must be provided to verify the duration of absence?",
    "What is the significance of the arbitration seat being in Singapore and the tribunal consisting of one arbitrator, especially in disputes involving insured persons who are expatriates or foreigners residing in Singapore?",
    "How does the requirement for arbitration proceedings to be conducted in English impact insured persons who are non-native English speakers, and are there provisions for translation or interpretation?",
    "In cases where the policy automatically terminates due to the insured's change in residency status, how does this termination interact with any claims arising from incidents occurring before the status change?",
    "What are the implications of automatic policy termination for expatriates or foreigners holding various passes (employment, work permit, dependent, student, long-term visit) if their pass expires or is revoked during the policy period?",
    "How does the policy define 'ordinarily residing in Singapore' for the purpose of automatic termination, and how might temporary overseas assignments or travel affect this status and policy validity?",
    "If the insured is away from Singapore for multiple periods totaling more than 183 days but not consecutively, does the policy automatically terminate, and how is this calculated or evidenced?",
    "How does the automatic termination clause interact with the cancellation provisions of the policy, and under what circumstances might cancellation occur independently of automatic termination?",
    "What documentation or proof is required to demonstrate that the insured has attained the age of sixty-six, and how is the termination date determined in relation to the birthday?",
    "In the event of automatic termination due to death, how are beneficiaries or claimants notified, and what is the process for handling any pending claims or benefits?",
    "How does the policy address situations where the insured loses Singapore citizenship or permanent residency but immediately applies for and obtains another valid pass allowing residence in Singapore?",
    "If the insured is temporarily outside Singapore for exactly 183 days, does the policy remain in force, and how is the timing of return or departure verified for termination purposes?",
    "What are the consequences if the insured fails to notify the insurer of a change in residency status or prolonged absence from Singapore, and how might this affect claim validity or policy termination?",
    "How does the arbitration clause interact with the automatic termination clause if a dispute arises regarding whether the policy was valid at the time of an incident or claim?",
    "Are there any exceptions or grace periods allowed under the automatic termination clause for expatriates or foreigners whose passes expire but who are in the process of renewal or appeal?",
    "How does the policy ensure compliance with the automatic termination conditions when the insured holds multiple passes or changes pass types during the policy period?",
