The due observance and compliance of these conditions by You or the claimant and the truth of the statements and answers in the proposal shall be conditions precedent to any liability of Us to make any payment under this Policy.\n\n11. **Duplication of Cover**\n\nWe shall not cover You under more than one Hospital Protect360 Insurance policy. In the event that You are covered under more than one such policy, We will consider You to be insured under the policy first issued and We will refund any duplicate insurance premium payment, which may have been made by or on behalf of You.\n\n12. **Eligibility**",
