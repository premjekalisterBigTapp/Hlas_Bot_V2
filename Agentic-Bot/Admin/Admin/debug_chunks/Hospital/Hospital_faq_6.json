    "How does the policy interact with any mandatory quarantine or COVID-19 related travel restrictions that might extend the overseas stay beyond 183 days?",
    "If a policyholder's overseas trip is cut short due to a covered event, does the policy adjust the 183-day coverage limit accordingly for future trips within the Period of Insurance?",
    "Does the policy require the insured to notify the insurer if their overseas stay is expected to approach or exceed the 183-day limit, and what are the consequences of non-disclosure?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations if the overseas travel is undertaken for the purpose of receiving medical treatment, especially if the treatment duration exceeds 183 days?",
    "How does the policy define 'overseas' in relation to coverage—does it include territories or regions closely associated with Singapore, and how does this affect the 183-day coverage limit?"
