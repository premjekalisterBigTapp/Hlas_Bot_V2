    "How does the definition of Pre-Existing Conditions incorporate prior knowledge, diagnosis, treatment, investigation status, and medical advice before the Policy start date, and how might this affect coverage eligibility?",
    "In what ways does the Policy Schedule interact with the main Policy document and Endorsements to define the specific terms and conditions applicable to an insured individual?",
    "How does the inclusion of 'should reasonably have been aware' in the Pre-Existing Conditions definition influence the assessment of coverage for conditions that may not have been formally diagnosed but are medically evident before the Policy start?",
    "What role do the application form and declarations play alongside the Policy and Policy Schedule in establishing the insured's coverage and obligations?",
    "How might a condition under investigation with pending results before the Policy start date be treated under the Pre-Existing Conditions exclusion or coverage?",
    "If a medical practitioner advised treatment before the Policy start date but the insured did not follow through, how does this impact the classification of that condition as Pre-Existing?",
    "How do Endorsements issued after the initial Policy issuance modify or clarify the terms related to Pre-Existing Conditions and overall coverage?",
    "What are the implications if an insured fails to disclose knowledge of an Injury or Illness existing before the Effective Date of Cover as defined in the Pre-Existing Conditions clause?",
    "How does the Policy define the Effective Date of Cover in relation to the start of the Policy, and how does this affect the determination of Pre-Existing Conditions?",

    "How does the Policy address situations where an insured was unaware of a condition that should reasonably have been known based on medically accepted pathological development before the Policy start?",
    "How might the definitions provided affect claims where the diagnosis or treatment of a condition occurred shortly after the Policy start but the condition existed beforehand?",
    "What is the significance of including both the Policy Schedule and any Endorsements in the overall definition of the Policy for coverage determination?",
    "How does the Policy treat conditions that were not symptomatic or diagnosed but for which the insured had received medical advice before the Policy start date?",
    "In what ways could the insured's failure to disclose an Injury or Illness under investigation before the Policy start impact claim validity under the Pre-Existing Conditions clause?",
    "How does the Policy's definition of Pre-Existing Conditions interact with any optional covers or waivers that might be available for such conditions?",
    "What are the potential consequences if the insured's medical history changes between the application submission and the Policy Effective Date, considering the definitions provided?",
