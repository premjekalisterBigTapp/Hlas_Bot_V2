  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address claims arising from injuries when the insured was under the influence of alcohol, and what proof is required to establish that alcohol was not a contributing factor?",
    "In what ways do wilful, malicious, criminal, or unlawful acts committed by the insured or their agents affect claim eligibility, and how does this exclusion interact with other policy provisions?",
    "Under what circumstances does the policy cover cosmetic or plastic surgery, and how are complications related to such procedures treated if they are not directly caused by an injury during the insured period?",
    "How are congenital anomalies and conditions resulting from them excluded from coverage, and what implications does this have for claims involving physical impairments present before the insured period?",
    "What are the limitations on coverage for air travel and aerial activities, specifically regarding the requirement to be a fare-paying passenger on a properly licensed commercial airline operating between established airports?",
    "How does the exclusion of trade, technical, or sporting activities related to aircraft or vessels impact coverage for injuries sustained during such activities, and are there any exceptions?",
    "If an insured suffers an injury during a non-commercial flight or aerial activity, how does this exclusion affect the claim, and what documentation would be necessary to demonstrate coverage or denial?",
    "In cases where the insured undergoes cosmetic surgery to correct a condition caused by an injury during the policy period, how does the policy define the scope of covered procedures and related complications?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between injuries caused by congenital conditions versus those caused by external injury during the insured period, and what evidence is required to support claims in borderline cases?",

    "Are there any provisions or exceptions in the policy that allow coverage for cosmetic or plastic surgery not directly related to injury, such as elective procedures, and how are complications from these handled?",
    "How does the policy address injuries or conditions arising from congenital anomalies that manifest or worsen during the insured period, and what documentation is required to differentiate these from covered injuries?",
    "What specific criteria must be met for air travel to be considered covered under the policy, and how are flights on non-scheduled or private aircraft treated?",
    "How does the exclusion of trade, technical, or sporting activities connected to aircraft or vessels affect claims for injuries sustained during recreational flying or boating activities?",
    "If an insured is injured during a commercial flight but also engaged in a trade or technical activity related to the aircraft, how does the policy determine coverage eligibility?",
    "What are the implications of the policy's exclusions for claims involving injuries sustained while under the influence of alcohol but where the insured contests the insurer's assessment of alcohol's role?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for complications arising from cosmetic surgery that was initially covered due to injury, especially if complications occur after the policy period?",
    "In situations where an insured participates in aerial activities as a non-fare-paying passenger or on non-licensed flights, how does the policy's exclusion apply, and what evidence is needed to support a claim denial?"
