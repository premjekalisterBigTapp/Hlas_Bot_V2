  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define coverage exclusions for full-time military personnel, law enforcement officers, and civil defence officers while on duty, and what implications does this have for claims arising from incidents during their official duties?",
    "In what ways are aircrew and pilots excluded from coverage under this policy, and how might this exclusion affect claims related to aviation accidents or incidents during flight operations?",
    "What are the specific exclusions related to shipyard workers, stevedores, offshore occupations such as divers, rig workers, fishermen, ship crew, and sailors, and how do these exclusions interact with claims arising from maritime or offshore incidents?",
    "How does the policy address workers engaged in maintenance, cleaning, roofing, or repair activities involving scaffolding, gondolas, or cranes, and what conditions must be met for claims to be considered valid or excluded?",
    "What limitations or exclusions apply to building demolition workers, construction workers, machinists, machine operators, and workers operating underground, in tunnels, or quarries, especially in relation to occupational hazards and injury claims?",
    "How does the exclusion of occupations involving handling explosives, ammunitions, firearms, poisonous, flammable, or hazardous gases or substances affect coverage, and what documentation or proof is required to establish the nature of the occupation in a claim?",
    "Are there any exceptions or conditions under which full-time military personnel or law enforcement officers might still be covered despite the general exclusion while on duty, particularly in off-duty scenarios or non-operational incidents?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between different types of offshore occupations such as divers, rig workers, and fishermen in terms of coverage exclusions, and what impact does this have on claims related to accidents at sea?",
    "What role do the specific activities involving scaffolding, gondolas, or cranes play in determining the applicability of exclusions for maintenance, cleaning, roofing, or repair workers, and how might this affect claims for injuries sustained during such work?",
    "How are risks associated with underground work, tunnel operations, and quarry activities addressed in the policy exclusions, and what evidence is required to confirm the claimant’s occupation in these high-risk environments?",
    "In cases involving handling of hazardous substances including liquids, solvents, and chemicals, how does the policy define the scope of exclusions, and what are the implications for claims involving exposure or accidents related to these substances?",
    "How do the exclusions for occupations involving explosives, firearms, and hazardous gases interact with general policy exclusions related to dangerous activities or illegal acts, and which exclusion takes precedence in claim assessments?",
    "What documentation or proof is typically required to verify that a claimant’s occupation falls within the excluded categories such as ship crew, construction worker, or aircrew, and how does this affect the claims process?",
    "How does the policy treat claims arising from injuries or incidents that occur outside of work hours for individuals in excluded occupations like military personnel or security guards, and what conditions determine coverage eligibility?",
    "Are there any provisions for coverage extensions or exceptions for workers in high-risk occupations if additional optional covers or riders are purchased, and how do these interact with the stated exclusions?",
    "How does the policy address situations where a claimant’s occupation involves multiple roles, some excluded (e.g., pilot) and some not, and how is coverage determined in such mixed-occupation scenarios?",
    "What impact do these occupation-based exclusions have on claims related to travel insurance coverage, particularly for insured persons traveling for work purposes in the excluded occupations?",
    "How are injuries or losses resulting from accidents involving machinery or equipment operated by machinists or machine operators treated under the policy exclusions, and what evidence is needed to establish the occupational context?",
    "In the event of a claim involving exposure to poisonous or flammable substances, how does the policy differentiate between occupational exposure covered by exclusions and incidental exposure covered under general benefits?",
    "How do these occupation exclusions interact with other policy-wide general exclusions such as pre-existing conditions, and what is the combined effect on claim eligibility for insured persons in these high-risk jobs?"
