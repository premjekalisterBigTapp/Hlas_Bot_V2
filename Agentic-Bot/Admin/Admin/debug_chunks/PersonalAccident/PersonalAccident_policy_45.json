  "questions": [
    "How does the policy exclude coverage for congenital anomalies and related physical impairments, and how might this exclusion interact with claims arising from pre-existing conditions?",
    "Under what conditions is air travel covered, and how do exclusions apply to non-commercial or non-licensed aerial activities versus travel as a fare-paying passenger on scheduled commercial airlines?",
    "How does the policy treat claims arising from trade, technical, or sporting activities involving aircraft or vessels, and what documentation or proof might be required to establish the nature of the activity?",
    "What are the specific exclusions related to high-risk water and aerial sports such as rafting on white water rapids, bungee jumping, jet skiing, and parasailing, and how do these exclusions affect claims for injuries sustained during such activities?",
    "How does the policy define and exclude coverage for skiing-related activities, including ski racing, backcountry skiing, off-piste skiing, and ski jumping, and are there any exceptions for skiing on man-made walls?",
    "In what ways does the exclusion of motorcycling as a rider or pillion impact coverage, and how might this exclusion apply if the insured was a passenger on a motorcycle involved in an accident?",
    "How does the policy address participation in terrorism activities, and what implications does this have for claims arising from incidents linked to such activities?",
    "What exclusions apply to employment-related risks, and how might coverage be affected if the insured is employed in certain high-risk occupations or activities?",
    "How do the exclusions for aerial activities reconcile with the general coverage for travel by commercial airlines, especially in cases of chartered or private flights?",
    "What documentation or evidence might be necessary to demonstrate that an activity involving an aircraft or vessel was not a trade, technical, or sporting activity excluded under the policy?",
    "How are underwater activities involving artificial breathing apparatus excluded, and what are the implications for claims related to recreational scuba diving or similar activities?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between permitted and excluded skiing activities, and what impact does this have on claims for injuries sustained during off-piste skiing compared to skiing on man-made walls?",
    "What are the consequences of participating in excluded high-risk sports like hang gliding or parachuting on the validity of a claim, and how might this exclusion interact with any optional covers or riders?",
    "How does the exclusion of motorcycling affect claims if the insured was involved in a motorcycle accident while not actively riding, such as being a pedestrian or in a nearby vehicle?",
    "In cases where the insured is involved in an aerial activity not covered by the policy, what options exist for coverage or claim appeal, especially if the activity was part of a travel itinerary?",
    "How does the policy's exclusion of terrorism activities interact with general exclusions related to war or civil unrest, and what documentation is required to establish the nature of the incident?",
    "What are the implications of the exclusion of trade, technical, or sporting activities involving aircraft or vessels for insured persons who engage in such activities recreationally versus professionally?",
    "How does the policy address claims arising from injuries sustained during pot-holing, mountaineering, or rock climbing, and what exceptions exist for climbing on man-made walls?",
    "What is the scope of the exclusion related to employment, and how might this affect coverage for insured persons who engage in high-risk jobs or activities during their trip?",
    "How do the various activity-related exclusions collectively impact the overall risk profile of the insured, and what steps can insured persons take to ensure coverage for activities that might otherwise be excluded?"
