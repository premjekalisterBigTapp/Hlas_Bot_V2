  "content": "(c) The Policy has not been otherwise terminated; and\n(d) Any material changes has already been notified to and accepted by Us.\n**20. Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause**\nNotwithstanding any provision to the contrary within this Policy or any endorsement thereto, this insurance shall, in no case, be deemed to provide cover and be liable to pay any claim or provide any benefit hereunder to the extent that the provision of such cover, payment of such claim or provision of such benefit would expose the Company to any sanction, prohibition or restriction under United Nations resolutions or the trade or economic sanctions, laws or regulations of the European Union or United Kingdom or United States of America.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the requirement to notify and obtain acceptance for any material changes interact with the policy's termination conditions and the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause when a claim involves a sanctioned entity?",
    "In what scenarios would the policy be considered terminated under clause (c), and how does this termination affect coverage in relation to sanctions imposed by the United Nations or specified jurisdictions?",
    "How does the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause override other provisions in the policy when a claim payment would violate trade or economic sanctions from the EU, UK, USA, or UN?",
    "What is the impact on claim eligibility if a material change is not notified or accepted by the insurer, especially when the claim involves a party subject to international sanctions?",
    "How do the policy’s termination conditions and the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause collectively affect coverage when a policyholder’s status changes due to sanctions-related restrictions?",
    "If a claim arises from an event involving a sanctioned country or individual, how does the policy determine whether to deny coverage based on the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause despite other covered benefits?",
    "How does the insurer handle claims that would expose it to sanctions under multiple jurisdictions (UN, EU, UK, USA), and what precedence does the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause have over other policy terms?",
    "What documentation or proof is required to demonstrate compliance with the notification of material changes, and how might failure to comply interact with the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause during claim assessment?",
    "In cases where a policyholder unknowingly becomes subject to sanctions after policy inception, how do clauses (c) and (d) combined with the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause affect ongoing coverage and claim payments?",
    "How does the policy address situations where a claim is partially affected by sanctions, and what portion of the claim might be payable versus excluded under the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the policyholder or beneficiary is located in or transacts with a country under UN or specified sanctions, considering the policy termination and material change notification requirements?",
    "How does the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause interact with endorsements or riders that might otherwise extend or modify coverage, especially when sanctions apply?",
    "When a claim involves multiple insured parties, some of whom are subject to sanctions, how does the policy apply the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause in conjunction with termination and material change clauses?",
    "How does the insurer verify that providing coverage or claim payment would not violate sanctions, and what role do clauses (c) and (d) play in this verification process?",
    "If a policyholder fails to notify a material change that involves exposure to sanctioned entities, how does this affect the insurer’s liability under the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause?",
    "How do the policy’s termination conditions and the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause collectively limit coverage for claims arising from activities prohibited under UK or US trade sanctions?",
    "What is the effect of the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause on claims related to benefits or payments that would contravene economic sanctions, even if all other policy conditions, including notification of material changes, are met?",
    "How does the policy ensure compliance with international sanctions laws when accepting material changes or endorsements, and what happens if such acceptance inadvertently leads to sanction violations?",
    "In what ways can the policyholder mitigate risks related to sanctions to maintain coverage, considering the requirements for notification of material changes and the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause?",
    "How does the Sanction Limitation and Exclusion Clause affect the insurer’s obligations if a claim payment would result in a breach of sanctions despite no prior notification of material changes or policy termination?"
