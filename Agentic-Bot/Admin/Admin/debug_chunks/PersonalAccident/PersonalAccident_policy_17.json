    "What are the consequences for coverage if the policyholder attempts to claim Death benefits for an Accident occurring after the policy's Expiry Date?",
    "How does the policy define the start and end of coverage periods for monthly policies compared to annual policies, and how does this affect claims for Death within twelve months of an Accident?",
    "If an Accident occurs shortly before the Expiry Date, how does the policy ensure coverage for Death occurring within the twelve-month window after the Accident?",
    "How does the policy's definition of Death interact with any general exclusions or conditions related to the timing of claims and policy periods?",
