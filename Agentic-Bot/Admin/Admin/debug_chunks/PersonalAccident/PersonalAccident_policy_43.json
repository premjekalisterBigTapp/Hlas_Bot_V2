  "questions": [
    "How does the policy treat claims related to injury, illness, or death caused by suicide or attempted suicide, and are there any exceptions when such acts are performed to save human life?",
    "In what ways are pregnancy-related events such as miscarriage, abortion, or childbirth excluded from coverage, and does this exclusion apply to all sections of the policy or only specific ones?",
    "How does the exclusion of Infectious Diseases, venereal diseases, HIV, AIDS, and their mutant derivatives interact with Section 2 of the policy, and what implications does this have for claims involving infectious diseases?",
    "What are the policy's provisions regarding mental, nervous, or sleep disorders, including diagnosed psychological conditions like anxiety or depression, and how do these exclusions affect claims for related medical treatments?",
    "How are Pre-Existing Conditions defined and excluded under this policy, and what impact does this have on coverage for illnesses or injuries that existed prior to the policy inception?",
    "If a claim involves an injury indirectly caused by wilful exposure to peril, how does the policy determine coverage eligibility, especially when the peril was not intended to save human life?",
    "Are there any circumstances under which the policy would cover legal liability arising from infectious diseases or HIV-related illnesses, given the general exclusions stated?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for mental or nervous disorders that manifest during the trip but have no prior diagnosis, considering the exclusion of diagnosed psychological or psychiatric disorders?",
    "In cases where a traveler experiences complications from pregnancy during the trip, such as premature childbirth, how does the exclusion apply, and are any related medical expenses covered?",
    "How do the exclusions for suicide and self-injury interact with any optional covers or extensions that might be expressly stated elsewhere in the policy?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to establish that an injury or illness was not caused by any of the excluded conditions such as pre-existing conditions or mental disorders?",
    "If a traveler contracts an infectious disease that is not explicitly covered under Section 2, how does the policy exclusion affect claims for medical treatment and related expenses?",
    "How does the policy address claims related to death caused by HIV or AIDS when the diagnosis occurs during the insured trip, considering the exclusion of these diseases?",
    "Are there any exceptions or extensions in the policy that override the general exclusion of pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, or childbirth, and how would these affect claim outcomes?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between injuries caused by wilful exposure to peril and accidental injuries, and what evidence is needed to support claims in borderline cases?",
    "In the event of a claim involving mental health conditions, how does the policy treat newly developed symptoms versus pre-existing diagnosed disorders?",
    "What is the impact of the exclusion of pre-existing conditions on claims for treatment of complications arising from such conditions during the insured trip?",
