    "How does the policy handle claims for modification work that is incomplete at the time of claim submission, and what implications does this have for timing and documentation?",

    "What is the process for determining whether a modification work 'aids mobility' sufficiently to qualify for coverage under Section 8, and who makes this assessment?",
    "If a claimant has already received payment for one residence modification work and subsequently requires modifications to another residence due to the same injury, how does the policy handle this situation?",
    "How does the policy interact with general exclusions related to pre-existing conditions or injuries when assessing eligibility for home care modification benefits under Section 8?",
    "Are there any time limits or deadlines within which the modification work must be completed and claimed under Section 8, and how do these affect claim validity?",
    "How does the policy treat claims where modification work is performed by a family member or non-professional contractor, particularly in relation to proof of costs and completion?",
