  "questions": [
    "How does the compensation percentage vary between losing two phalanges versus one phalanx of the index finger, and what documentation is required to prove permanent disablement or physical severance?",
    "In the event of losing three phalanges of the middle finger, what percentage of the benefit limit is payable, and how does this compare to losing two or one phalanx of the same finger?",
    "If a claimant suffers permanent disablement of one phalanx of the middle finger, what is the scale of compensation, and how might this interact with any general exclusions related to pre-existing conditions?",
    "What is the compensation scale for the loss of three phalanges of a ring finger, and how would this be affected if the injury occurred during a covered trip versus an excluded activity?",
    "How are losses by physical severance distinguished from permanent disablement in terms of compensation percentages for the index, middle, and ring fingers?",
    "If a claimant loses two phalanges of the middle finger, what percentage of the benefit limit applies, and what conditions must be met for the claim to be valid under the policy?",
    "How does the policy define the scale of compensation for partial losses (one or two phalanges) compared to complete loss (three phalanges) across different fingers, and what implications does this have for claim assessment?",
    "In cases where multiple fingers are injured with varying degrees of phalange loss, how are the compensation percentages applied cumulatively or separately according to the policy?",
    "What are the potential exclusions or limitations that could affect claims for permanent disablement of fingers, especially when the injury involves only one phalanx versus multiple phalanges?",
    "How does the policy address compensation if the loss of phalanges occurs due to an accident that is not covered under the general exclusions, such as self-inflicted injury or war-related incidents?",
    "For the loss of one phalanx of the index finger, what is the compensation percentage, and how might this be impacted if the injury was sustained during a quarantine period or COVID-related event?",
    "How does the scale of compensation for the ring finger compare to that of the index and middle fingers when three phalanges are lost, and what documentation is required to substantiate the claim?",
    "If a claimant experiences permanent disablement rather than physical severance of two phalanges of the index finger, does the compensation scale differ, and how is this distinction verified?",
    "What is the rationale behind assigning different compensation percentages to the loss of phalanges on different fingers, and how might this affect claims involving multiple finger injuries?",
    "How does the policy handle claims where the injury results in partial loss of function rather than complete physical severance, particularly for one phalanx of the middle finger?",
    "In the event of a claim for loss of phalanges, what role do medical reports and itemized bills play in determining the eligibility and scale of compensation?",
    "How would the compensation scale apply if the insured loses two phalanges of the middle finger but the injury was caused by an excluded peril under the general exclusions section?",
    "If a claimant loses three phalanges of the ring finger but the injury occurred before the policy inception date, how does the policy address such a claim in terms of compensation eligibility?",
    "How does the policy coordinate the scale of compensation for finger phalange loss with any other benefits or limits that may apply under the broader accidental injury section?",
    "What are the implications for compensation if the loss of phalanges is bilateral (both hands), and does the policy specify any cumulative limits or conditions for such scenarios?"
