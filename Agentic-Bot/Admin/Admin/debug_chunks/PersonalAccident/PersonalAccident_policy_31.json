  "questions": [
    "How does the policy determine the compensation percentage for the loss or permanent disablement of varying numbers of phalanges on the ring finger, and how does this compare to the compensation for the little finger?",
    "In cases where a claimant suffers permanent disablement rather than physical severance of phalanges on the ring or little finger, how is the Scale of Compensation applied and documented?",
    "What documentation or medical evidence is required to substantiate claims for loss by physical severance or permanent disablement of one, two, or three phalanges on the ring or little finger?",
    "If a claimant loses three phalanges on the ring finger and two phalanges on the little finger in a single incident, how are the compensation percentages calculated and combined under the policy?",
    "How does the policy address partial loss scenarios where only one or two phalanges are lost or disabled on either the ring or little finger, and what are the implications for the overall Benefit Limit?",
    "Are there any general exclusions or conditions in the policy that would override or affect the Scale of Compensation for loss or disablement of phalanges on the ring or little finger?",
    "In the event of permanent disablement of phalanges due to injury sustained during travel, how does the timing of medical assessment impact the eligibility and calculation of compensation under this Scale?",
    "Does the policy provide any guidance on how to handle claims involving simultaneous loss or disablement of phalanges on multiple fingers, specifically the ring and little fingers, and how does this affect the total payout?",
    "How does the policy define 'physical severance' and 'permanent disablement' in the context of phalange loss, and what criteria must be met to qualify for the specified Scale of Compensation?",
    "If a claimant experiences loss of phalanges on the ring or little finger due to an excluded cause under the policy's general exclusions, how does this affect the applicability of the Scale of Compensation?",
    "What is the process for determining the Benefit Limit against which the percentage compensation for phalange loss or disablement is calculated, and does this limit vary by age or plan type?",
    "How does the policy handle cases where the loss or disablement of phalanges occurs gradually or is diagnosed after the trip, in terms of claim timing and compensation eligibility?",
    "Are there any provisions in the policy that allow for reassessment or appeal if the initial determination of the number of phalanges lost or disabled on the ring or little finger is disputed?",
    "In the event of loss by physical severance of one phalanx on the ring finger and one phalanx on the little finger, how is the total compensation percentage calculated and applied to the Benefit Limit?",
    "Does the policy include any specific exclusions or limitations for claims related to loss or disablement of phalanges caused by pre-existing conditions or congenital anomalies?",
    "How does the Scale of Compensation for phalange loss on the ring and little fingers interact with other sections of the policy that cover permanent disablement or accidental injury?",
    "What are the implications for claimants if the loss or disablement of phalanges occurs outside the defined trip period or is not reported within the required timeframe?",
    "In cases where the loss of phalanges is partial and does not meet the threshold for permanent disablement, how does the policy address compensation eligibility or denial?",
    "How does the policy ensure that compensation for loss or disablement of phalanges on the ring and little fingers does not exceed the overall Benefit Limit when combined with other injury claims?",
    "Are there any special considerations or exceptions in the policy for loss or disablement of phalanges due to infectious diseases or complications arising during travel?"
