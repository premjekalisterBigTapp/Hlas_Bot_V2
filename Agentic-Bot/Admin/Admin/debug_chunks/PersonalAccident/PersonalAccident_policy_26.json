  "questions": [
    "How does the Scale of Compensation apply differently between Accidental Death and Permanent Total Disablement in terms of percentage of the Benefit Limit?",
    "In cases of loss of sight, how is the compensation calculated when one eye is lost compared to both eyes, and what percentage of the Benefit Limit is payable?",
    "What is the compensation scale for the physical severance of one limb versus two limbs, and how does this relate to the overall Benefit Limit?",
    "How does the policy differentiate compensation between the loss of one hand and the loss of one arm above the elbow in terms of the Scale of Compensation?",
    "When a claimant suffers permanent disablement of an arm at or below the elbow, what percentage of the Benefit Limit is payable, and how does this compare to other types of limb losses?",
    "Does the Scale of Compensation provide the same percentage for loss of hands as it does for loss of arms, and what implications does this have for claimants?",
    "How is the compensation structured for permanent disablement versus physical severance of limbs, and are both treated equally under the Scale of Compensation?",
    "In the event of accidental death occurring simultaneously with permanent total disablement, how would the Scale of Compensation apply to the Benefit Limit?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to establish the loss by physical severance or permanent disablement of limbs or eyes to qualify for the 100% Benefit Limit compensation?",
    "How does the policy define 'loss' in the context of physical severance or permanent disablement for the purpose of applying the Scale of Compensation?",
    "Are there any distinctions in compensation if the loss involves one hand versus two hands, and how does the Scale of Compensation address multiple losses?",
    "If a claimant loses sight in one eye and also suffers permanent disablement of a limb, how would the Scale of Compensation apply to the total Benefit Limit?",
    "Does the Scale of Compensation cover partial loss or partial disablement of limbs or eyes, or is it strictly for total loss as specified?",
    "How does the policy handle compensation if the loss occurs gradually leading to permanent disablement rather than sudden physical severance?",
    "In cases where the loss is of an arm at or below the elbow combined with loss of a hand, how is the Scale of Compensation calculated to avoid overlap or duplication?",
    "What are the implications for claimants if the loss involves multiple categories listed (e.g., loss of sight and loss of limbs) in terms of cumulative compensation under the Scale of Compensation?",
    "How does the Scale of Compensation interact with any general exclusions or limitations that might affect claims for accidental death or permanent disablement?",
    "Is there any indication that the Scale of Compensation varies based on the insured person's age or other demographic factors?",
    "How does the policy ensure that the compensation for loss of limbs or sight is equitable when comparing losses above and below the elbow or involving one versus two limbs?",
    "What scenarios might lead to disputes over whether a loss qualifies as permanent disablement or physical severance under the Scale of Compensation, and how might these affect claim outcomes?"
