    "In what way must the Policy Schedule and the policy text be read together to determine the meaning of terms and the application of benefit limits?",
    "How does the policy ensure consistency in the interpretation of specific terms across different sections, and what is the impact on claims involving benefit limits?",

    "How does the definition of 'Accident/Accidental' as a sudden, unforeseen, and unexpected event during the Period of Insurance influence the eligibility for benefits under the policy?",
    "Can an event that is not sudden or unforeseen qualify as an 'Accident/Accidental' under this policy, and how would that affect the maximum benefit payable?",
    "How does the policy's definition of 'Benefit Limit' interact with the Coverage Outline in the Policy Schedule when determining the maximum payable amount for a claim?",
    "If a term is defined differently in the Policy Schedule and the main policy text, which definition applies when assessing claims and benefit limits?",
    "How might the requirement that the 'Accident/Accidental' event occurs during the Period of Insurance affect claims for injuries or damages that manifest after the policy period?",
    "What role does the Policy Schedule play in clarifying or modifying the definitions provided in the main policy document, particularly regarding benefit limits and accident definitions?",
    "How does the policy treat the interpretation of terms that appear multiple times across the contract, and what implications does this have for benefit limit calculations?",
    "In cases where the Coverage Outline specifies a Benefit Limit, how does the policy ensure that this limit is consistently applied in claims arising from accidents as defined?",
    "How does the policy's definition of 'Accident/Accidental' exclude or include events that are expected or planned, and what effect does this have on the maximum benefit payable?",

    "How does the policy address potential conflicts between definitions in the Policy Schedule and the main policy text, especially regarding the interpretation of accidents and benefit limits?",
    "In what ways does the policy's definition of 'Benefit Limit' as the maximum payable amount impact the handling of multiple claims arising from a single accident?",
    "How does the policy ensure that the definitions provided apply uniformly across all sections and claims, particularly when determining if an event qualifies as an accident within the insured period?",
    "What are the implications for a claim if an event occurs outside the Period of Insurance but meets the other criteria of an 'Accident/Accidental' as defined?",
    "How does the policy's instruction to read the Policy Schedule and policy together affect the understanding of terms like 'Accident/Accidental' and 'Benefit Limit' in complex claims scenarios?",
