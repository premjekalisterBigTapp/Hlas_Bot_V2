  "content": "2. **Exposure** - If following an Accident, You are unavoidably exposed to the natural elements and as a direct result of such exposure suffer a Death or Permanent Disablement, We will consider such Death or Permanent Disablement as having been caused by an Injury.\n3. **Terrorism Cover** - This Policy covers losses which may be sustained through acts of terrorism provided that there is no liability when such acts of terrorism involve the use of biological, chemical agents or nuclear devices, provided that You did not participate in or provoke such acts of terrorism. Where You are insured under more than one policy with Us covering acts of terrorism, Our maximum liability for any and all claims arising directly or indirectly from any act of terrorism will be limited to one policy only (with the highest limit on acts of terrorism where applicable).",
