  "questions": [
    "How is compensation calculated for the permanent disablement of the index finger when one, two, or three phalanges are affected, and how does this compare to the compensation for similar injuries to the middle and ring fingers?",
    "In the event of physical severance of the middle finger involving two phalanges, what percentage of the Benefit Limit is payable, and how does this differ from the loss of one or three phalanges of the same finger?",
    "If a claimant suffers permanent disablement of the ring finger involving one phalanx, what compensation percentage applies, and is this scenario covered under the same terms as physical severance?",
    "When multiple fingers are injured with varying degrees of phalange loss, how does the policy determine the total compensation, and are the percentages additive or subject to a maximum Benefit Limit?",
    "Does the policy differentiate between physical severance and permanent disablement in terms of compensation percentages for finger injuries, and if so, how are these terms defined and applied?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations in the policy regarding compensation for partial loss of fingers, such as injuries caused by pre-existing conditions or self-inflicted harm?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for loss of phalanges on fingers other than the index, middle, or ring fingers, and are these covered under a different schedule or excluded entirely?",
    "In cases where the injury involves the loss of multiple phalanges across different fingers (e.g., index finger three phalanges and middle finger one phalanx), how is the compensation calculated relative to the Benefit Limit?",
    "What documentation or medical evidence is required to substantiate claims for permanent disablement or physical severance of finger phalanges, and are there specific reporting timeframes?",
    "If an insured person experiences permanent disablement of the index finger involving two phalanges but later recovers partial function, how does the policy address changes in compensation eligibility?",
    "Are there any age-related conditions or restrictions on claiming compensation for finger phalange loss or disablement under this policy section?",
    "How does the policy define 'physical severance' and 'permanent disablement' for the purposes of calculating compensation for finger injuries, and do these definitions affect claim outcomes?",
    "In the event of a claim for loss of the ring finger involving two phalanges, what is the exact compensation percentage, and how does this compare to the middle finger with the same injury?",
    "Does the policy provide any benefits or compensation for injuries to the thumb or little finger, or are these fingers excluded from the listed compensation schedule?",
    "How does the policy address compensation if the injury to a finger involves damage to phalanges not explicitly listed (e.g., partial fractures without severance), and are these covered under permanent disablement?",
    "Are there any general or section-specific exclusions that would negate compensation for finger phalange loss, such as injuries sustained during high-risk activities or due to war or terrorism?",
    "If a claimant suffers loss of one phalanx of the middle finger and one phalanx of the ring finger simultaneously, how are the compensation percentages combined, and what is the maximum payable under the Benefit Limit?",
    "Does the policy require that the loss or disablement be permanent to qualify for compensation, and how is permanence medically determined or verified?",
    "Are there any provisions for partial compensation if the injury occurs but does not result in full severance or permanent disablement of the specified phalanges?",
    "How does the policy handle claims where the injury to the finger phalanges occurs during a trip covered by the policy, but the disablement is only diagnosed after returning home?"
