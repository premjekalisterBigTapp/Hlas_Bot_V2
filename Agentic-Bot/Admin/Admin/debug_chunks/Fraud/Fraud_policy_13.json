    "In what scenarios would treatment received at a facility not classified as a 'Hospital' under this policy, such as a nursing home or rehabilitation centre, be excluded from coverage for medical expenses?",
    "How does the requirement for a 'Hospital' to have 24-hour nursing services by legally qualified registered nurses and supervision by Registered Medical Practitioners impact claims for emergency treatments received at clinics or day surgery centres?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a patient is admitted to a mental institution or geriatric care facility that is explicitly excluded from the definition of 'Hospital' in this policy?",

    "How does the policy distinguish between coverage for medical treatment received at a hospital versus a clinic, and what documentation is required to prove the facility meets the 'Hospital' definition?",

    "How does the definition of 'Home' affect claims related to temporary residences or secondary properties where the insured may reside during travel or work assignments?",
    "What are the consequences for claims if the insured receives treatment at a facility primarily used for the care of alcoholics or drug addicts, given the exclusion in the hospital definition?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where a facility provides both hospital services and excluded services like mental health or geriatric care within the same institution?",
    "What documentation or proof is required to establish that a facility qualifies as a 'Hospital' under this policy's definition when submitting a claim for medical expenses?",
