    "In cases of permanent disablement of the ring finger or little finger, what documentation or medical evidence is required to substantiate the degree of phalange loss for compensation purposes?",
    "How does the policy define 'physical severance' and 'permanent disablement' in the context of finger and toe phalange loss, and do these definitions affect eligibility for the stated compensation percentages?",
    "If an insured person loses one phalanx on the little finger and one phalanx on the ring finger during the same incident, how are the compensation percentages applied relative to the Benefit Limit?",

    "Are there any age or pre-existing condition restrictions that affect eligibility for compensation related to loss of finger or toe phalanges as specified in the policy?",

    "What is the impact of the pair-and-sets clause, if any, on claims involving loss of multiple phalanges on fingers or toes, particularly if the injury affects symmetrical digits on both hands or feet?",
    "In cases where the loss of phalanges occurs due to an excluded cause under the policy's general exclusions, how does this affect the entitlement to the specified percentage compensation of the Benefit Limit?",
    "How does the policy address timing and reporting requirements for claims involving loss of finger or toe phalanges to ensure eligibility for the stated compensation percentages?",
    "If the insured experiences permanent disablement rather than physical severance of a phalanx, how is the degree of disablement assessed and compensated under the policy's provisions?",
    "Are there any specific exclusions or limitations related to injuries to the ring finger or little finger that might override the compensation percentages listed for physical severance or permanent disablement?",
    "How does the policy coordinate compensation for loss of phalanges with other benefits or covers that might apply in the event of bodily injury, and are these percentages additive or exclusive?"
