    "What types of fraudulent activities committed by a Third Party using Your Personal Data are covered under the Identity Theft Event definition, and how does this influence claim acceptance?",
    "How do the coverage limits for Cyber Event-related Computer System repairs compare to those for Identity Theft Event expenses, and are these limits combined or separate?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to demonstrate that a Cyber Event has occurred and that costs incurred were reasonable and necessary for coverage to apply?",
