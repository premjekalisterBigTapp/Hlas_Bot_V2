  "questions": [
    "How is the compensation percentage determined for permanent disablement of a leg at or below the knee compared to loss of sight in one eye, and what documentation is required to prove such losses?",
    "In cases of third degree burns to the head, how do different percentage thresholds (2%, 5%, 8%) affect the compensation amount, and what medical evidence must be submitted to validate the extent of burns?",
    "What distinctions are made between third degree burns to the head versus the body in terms of compensation percentages, and how are these percentages applied when the burn coverage falls within overlapping ranges?",
    "How does the policy define and compensate for loss of hearing in both ears, and are there any exclusions or conditions that might affect claims related to hearing loss?",
    "If a claimant suffers multiple injuries such as loss of sight in one eye and third degree burns to the body, how are the compensation percentages combined or prioritized under the policy?",
    "What are the specific conditions under which 100% compensation is granted for third degree burns to the body, and how does this compare to the compensation for burns covering 15% to less than 20% of the body?",
    "How does the policy address partial losses, such as loss of sight limited to perception of light, and are such cases excluded from compensation or compensated differently?",
    "In the event of physical severance of a leg below the knee, what is the process for assessing permanent disablement, and how does this affect the timing and amount of compensation?",
    "For third degree burns that are borderline between two compensation tiers (e.g., exactly 5% or 15%), how is the compensation percentage determined, and what role does medical assessment play in this determination?",
    "Are there any general or section-specific exclusions that would override the compensation percentages listed for burns, loss of sight, or hearing loss, such as pre-existing conditions or injuries sustained during excluded activities?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for loss of hearing in one ear compared to both ears, and is partial hearing loss compensated under any circumstances?",
    "What documentation or medical reports are required to substantiate claims for third degree burns, and how does the policy verify the percentage of body or head affected?",
    "In cases where the injury involves both a third degree burn and permanent disablement of a limb, how does the policy calculate the total compensation, and are there limits to combined claims?",
    "How are compensation limits applied when the injury involves multiple body parts with different burn percentages, such as 10% third degree burns to the body and 3% to the head?",
    "What is the policy's stance on compensation for loss of sight in one eye when the injury results only in perception of light, and how does this interact with any general exclusions?",
    "How does the policy define 'loss by physical severance' in relation to permanent disablement, and what evidence is required to prove the extent of disablement for compensation purposes?",
    "Are there any age or pre-existing condition restrictions that affect eligibility for compensation under the categories of burns, loss of sight, or hearing loss?",
    "How does the policy address the timing of claims and medical evaluations for injuries such as third degree burns or permanent disablement to ensure accurate compensation percentages?",
    "In the event of a claim involving third degree burns to the head and loss of hearing in both ears, how does the policy coordinate compensation percentages and benefit limits to avoid overpayment?",
    "What procedures must be followed if the injury percentage is disputed between the insured and the insurer, particularly for burns or hearing loss, and how does this affect the compensation awarded?"
