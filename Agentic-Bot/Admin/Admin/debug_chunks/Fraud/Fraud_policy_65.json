  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define exclusions related to occupations involving full-time military personnel, law enforcement officers, civil defence officers, navy, or firefighters, and how does the off-duty status affect coverage?",
    "In what ways are air crew members or pilots excluded from coverage, and are there any exceptions or conditions under which they might be covered?",
    "What are the specific exclusions for workers engaged in off-shore occupations such as divers, rig workers, fishermen, or ship crew, and how do these exclusions interact with general policy terms?",
    "How does the policy address coverage for workers involved in maintenance, cleaning, roofing, or repair activities that require the use of scaffolding or gondolas, and what are the implications for claims arising from such activities?",
    "What limitations or exclusions apply to construction workers operating at heights above 30 feet, working underground, in tunnels, demolition, or quarry environments, and how might these affect claim eligibility?",
    "How does the policy treat occupations that involve handling explosives, ammunitions, firearms, poisonous, or hazardous gases or substances, and what documentation or proof might be required to establish exclusion applicability?",
    "Are off-duty full-time military personnel, law enforcement officers, civil defence officers, navy, or firefighters covered under the policy, and how is off-duty status verified or defined?",
    "How do the occupational exclusions for air crew or pilots interact with other policy sections such as accident or medical coverage, especially for incidents occurring during non-flight duties?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a worker transitions between excluded occupations such as from a rig worker to a construction worker at heights above 30 feet during the insured period?",
    "How does the policy handle claims arising from accidents involving workers engaged in maintenance or repair activities when scaffolding or gondola usage is involved, particularly regarding proof of the work environment?",
    "In cases where construction workers are involved in accidents underground or in tunnels, what specific exclusions apply, and how might these differ from accidents occurring at surface-level construction sites?",
    "What are the policy's provisions regarding workers handling hazardous substances, and how does it distinguish between routine occupational exposure and accidental incidents for coverage purposes?",
    "How does the exclusion of certain occupations affect the eligibility for optional covers or riders that might otherwise provide coverage for high-risk activities?",
    "What documentation or evidence is required to demonstrate that an insured individual was engaged in an excluded occupation at the time of an incident, and how does this affect claim processing?",
    "Are there any exceptions or waivers to the occupational exclusions for off-shore workers such as fishermen or ship crew in cases of emergency or rescue operations?",
    "How does the policy define and verify the height threshold of 30 feet for construction workers, and what impact does this have on coverage for falls or related injuries?",
    "In the event of an accident involving explosives or firearms, how does the policy determine whether the occupation exclusion applies, especially if the insured was handling such items outside of work duties?",
    "How do the occupational exclusions interact with general policy exclusions related to hazardous activities or dangerous sports, and which takes precedence in claim adjudication?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a firefighter or law enforcement officer is injured while performing a secondary job or part-time work not listed in the exclusions?",
    "How does the policy address coverage for workers who perform multiple roles, some of which are excluded occupations, and how is coverage determined in mixed-occupation scenarios?"
