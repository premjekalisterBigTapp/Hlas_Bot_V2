  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define the compensation percentage for accidental death compared to permanent total disablement, and what documentation is required to prove each claim?",
    "In cases of loss of sight, how is compensation determined if the insured loses sight in one eye versus both eyes, and are there any conditions or exclusions that affect this benefit?",
    "What distinctions does the policy make between loss by physical severance and permanent disablement for limbs, and how do these distinctions impact the compensation amount?",
    "How is the compensation structured for the loss of one hand compared to two hands, and does the policy specify different proof or timing requirements for these claims?",
    "For arm injuries, how does the compensation differ between loss above the elbow and at or below the elbow, and what medical evidence is necessary to support these claims?",
    "What are the conditions under which loss of a leg above the knee versus at or below the knee qualifies for 100% compensation, and how does the policy address partial versus total disablement in these cases?",
    "Does the policy provide any guidance on how to handle claims involving multiple simultaneous losses, such as loss of one hand and one leg, in terms of cumulative compensation limits?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations that apply specifically to claims for loss of limbs or sight, and how do these interact with the general exclusions of the policy?",
    "How does the policy treat permanent disablement claims when the disablement is partial or temporary, and what criteria must be met to qualify for full benefit limit compensation?",
    "What is the process and required documentation for proving permanent total disablement, and how does the insurer verify the permanence and totality of the disablement?",
    "In the event of accidental death, how does the policy coordinate benefits with other sections or coverages, and are there any exclusions that could reduce or negate the payout?",
    "How does the policy define 'loss by physical severance' in relation to permanent disablement, and are there scenarios where one applies but not the other?",
    "What are the implications for compensation if the loss or disablement occurs during activities excluded under the general policy exclusions, such as hazardous sports or illegal acts?",
    "How does the policy handle claims where the loss of limbs or sight results from a pre-existing condition exacerbated by an accident, and is there an option for additional coverage in such cases?",
    "Are there any age-related conditions or limits that affect eligibility for the full benefit limit compensation for accidental death or permanent disablement?",
    "In cases where the insured suffers multiple losses (e.g., loss of sight and loss of a limb), how does the policy calculate total compensation, and are there maximum aggregate limits?",
    "What timing requirements or claim submission deadlines does the policy impose for accidental death and permanent disablement claims, and how do these affect claim approval?",
    "How does the policy address the valuation and compensation of loss when the injury results in partial but significant functional impairment rather than complete severance or disablement?",
    "Are there any specific exclusions or conditions related to the cause of injury (e.g., war, terrorism, self-inflicted injury) that would affect the payment of benefits for loss of limbs or sight?",
    "How does the policy ensure that compensation for loss of limbs or sight is not duplicated if the insured has other insurance policies covering similar risks, and what subrogation rights does the insurer have?"
