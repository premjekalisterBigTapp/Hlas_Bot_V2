  "content": "We will not pay for any Permanent Disablement that is not listed in the scale of compensation above.\n\n### COMPENSATION LIMITS\n\nWe shall not pay for:\n\n(a) any specific item of Permanent Disablement where that item is also comprised in any other item of Permanent Disablement for which a greater amount of compensation is payable in the circumstances. If benefit is payable for loss of use of a whole member of the body, the benefit for parts of the member cannot also be claimed.\n\n(b) Death in addition to any Permanent Disablement if caused by the same Accident, except that if a payment has been made under any part of Permanent Disablement, and Death occurs subsequently solely caused by and within twelve (12) months of the Accident, then We will pay any difference if the Compensation payable for Death is greater than that already paid for Permanent Disablement.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy determine compensation eligibility when a Permanent Disablement is not explicitly listed in the scale of compensation, and what implications does this have for claimants?",
    "In cases where multiple Permanent Disablement items apply to the same injury, how does the policy prioritize compensation amounts, especially when one item covers a whole member and others cover parts of that member?",
    "What are the conditions under which a claimant can receive both Death and Permanent Disablement benefits from the same Accident, and how does the timing of Death influence the payment?",
    "If a payment has already been made for Permanent Disablement and the insured subsequently dies within twelve months due to the same Accident, how does the policy calculate any additional compensation?",
    "How does the exclusion of unlisted Permanent Disablement items affect claims involving rare or unusual injuries not covered in the scale of compensation?",
    "When an Accident results in both partial and total loss of a body member, how does the policy prevent double compensation for overlapping Permanent Disablement items?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to establish that Death occurred solely due to the same Accident within the twelve-month period to qualify for additional compensation?",
    "How does the policy handle scenarios where the Death benefit is less than or equal to the Permanent Disablement benefit already paid for the same Accident?",
    "In what ways does the compensation limit clause (a) prevent claimants from aggregating benefits for multiple disablement items related to the same body part?",
    "How does the policy define 'loss of use' of a whole member versus parts of a member in the context of Permanent Disablement compensation?",
    "What are the implications for claimants if Death occurs more than twelve months after the Accident but is still related to the Permanent Disablement?",
    "How does the policy address situations where Permanent Disablement and Death are caused by different Accidents but occur within a close timeframe?",
    "What is the rationale behind excluding payment for any Permanent Disablement not listed in the scale, and how might this affect claims involving emerging medical conditions?",
    "How does the twelve-month time limit for Death following Permanent Disablement claims interact with potential delays in medical diagnosis or reporting?",
    "In cases where multiple injuries lead to different Permanent Disablement items, how does the policy determine which item has the greater compensation amount?",
    "How might the compensation limits affect claims involving partial loss of function versus complete loss of function of a body member?",
    "What exclusions or limitations might apply if a claimant attempts to claim for both Death and Permanent Disablement benefits from the same Accident outside the specified conditions?",
    "How does the policy ensure that compensation for Permanent Disablement is fair and not duplicated when overlapping injuries affect the same body part?",
    "What are the potential challenges in proving that Death was solely caused by the same Accident within twelve months for the purpose of additional compensation?",
    "How does the policy's compensation limit clause interact with any general exclusions that might also restrict payment for Permanent Disablement or Death benefits?"
