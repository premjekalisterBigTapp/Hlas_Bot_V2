  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address claims arising from injuries when the insured is under the influence of drugs not prescribed by a Registered Medical Practitioner, and how does this exclusion interact with prescribed drugs used for drug addiction treatment?",
    "In what circumstances can a claim be accepted if the insured was under the influence of alcohol at the time of injury, and what evidence must the claimant provide to satisfy the insurer that alcohol was not a contributing factor?",
    "How are congenital anomalies and conditions resulting from them treated under the policy, and what implications does this have for claims related to physical impairments?",
    "What are the coverage limitations for injuries sustained during air travel, specifically regarding the types of flights covered and the licensing requirements for the airline?",
    "How does the policy exclude coverage for injuries related to trade, technical, or sporting activities involving aircraft or vessels, and what examples might fall under this exclusion?",
    "If an insured person is injured while flying as a non-paying passenger or on a private aircraft, how does the policy's air travel exclusion affect claim eligibility?",
    "How does the exclusion of injuries under the influence of alcohol reconcile with situations where alcohol consumption is incidental but not causal to the injury?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required from a claimant to demonstrate that prescribed drugs were not used for drug addiction treatment in order to avoid exclusion under the drug influence clause?",
    "In cases where a congenital condition contributes indirectly to an injury, how does the policy determine whether the claim is excluded under the congenital anomalies clause?",
    "How does the policy define a 'properly licensed, regular scheduled commercial airline,' and what impact does this definition have on coverage for injuries occurring on chartered or irregular flights?",
    "Are injuries sustained during aerial sporting activities, such as skydiving or air racing, covered under the policy, considering the exclusion of sporting activities connected with aircraft?",
    "How does the exclusion of trade or technical activities involving aircraft or vessels affect claims arising from professional pilots or crew members traveling on duty?",
    "If an insured is injured while participating in a sporting event on a vessel, how does the policy's exclusion of sporting activities connected with vessels apply?",
    "What are the implications of the exclusion clauses on claims involving alcohol or drug influence when the insured is unconscious or unable to provide evidence regarding their state at the time of injury?",
    "How does the policy treat injuries occurring during air travel that involves stopovers or transfers between licensed commercial airports, especially if the insured leaves the aircraft during these stops?",
    "In the context of the exclusions, how are injuries from recreational flying activities, such as flying lessons or private pilot flights, handled under the policy?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between injuries caused directly by congenital anomalies and those caused by unrelated accidents in insured individuals with pre-existing physical impairments?",
    "What is the policy's stance on claims arising from injuries sustained during illegal or unlicensed aerial activities, and how does this interact with the general air travel exclusion?",
    "How might the exclusion of injuries under the influence of drugs or alcohol affect claims where the insured was prescribed medication that impairs judgment but is not related to addiction treatment?",
    "In what ways do the exclusions related to drug and alcohol influence, congenital conditions, and air travel collectively limit the scope of coverage for injuries occurring during complex scenarios involving multiple factors?"
