  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address coverage exclusions for injuries sustained during trade, technical, or sporting activities involving aircraft or vessels, and what documentation is required to prove the nature of the activity?",
    "In cases where a claimant is injured while participating in rafting or canoeing on white water rapids, how do the exclusions related to white water activities and the use of artificial breathing apparatus affect claim eligibility?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a policyholder is involved in motorcycling, either as a rider or pillion, and how does this exclusion interact with any optional covers or pre-existing condition clauses?",
    "How does the policy treat claims arising from participation in terrorism activities, and what evidence is necessary to establish that the incident was related to such activities?",
    "If a policyholder is employed as a professional sportsperson or racer earning remuneration, sponsorship, or awards, how does this employment status affect coverage for injuries sustained during sporting events other than on foot or trial of speed or reliability?",
    "For activities like ski racing, backcountry skiing, or off-piste skiing, which are excluded, how does the policy define these activities, and what exceptions exist for skiing on man-made walls?",
    "How are exclusions for underwater activities involving artificial breathing apparatus applied when the claimant is using compressed air or gas, and what documentation is needed to confirm the activity type?",
    "In the event of an injury during bungee jumping or jet skiing, what specific policy exclusions apply, and how do these exclusions interact with any general policy exclusions related to hazardous activities?",
    "How does the exclusion of hunting and pot-holing affect coverage for injuries sustained during these activities, and what proof is required to demonstrate that the claimant was engaged in such excluded activities?",
    "What is the policy's stance on coverage for mountaineering or rock climbing activities that require ropes or guides, and how is this distinguished from climbing on man-made walls?",
    "If a claim arises from participation in hang gliding, parasailing, or parachuting, how do the exclusions for these aerial activities impact the claim, and are there any exceptions or conditions under which coverage might still apply?",
    "How does the exclusion for the use of bobsleigh or skeleton sports affect claims, and what documentation must be provided to confirm participation in these specific activities?",
    "In cases where the policyholder is involved in motorcycling but only as a pillion passenger, how does the exclusion apply, and are there any circumstances under which coverage might be extended?",
    "How does the policy define 'professional sportspersons or racer' in the context of employment exclusions, and what types of remuneration or awards trigger the exclusion?",
    "What are the interactions between the exclusions for technical or sporting activities involving aircraft or vessels and general policy exclusions related to hazardous or extreme sports?",
    "How does the policy handle claims related to sporting activities that are trial of speed or reliability on foot, and why are these distinguished from other types of racing or sports?",
    "In the event of a claim involving multiple excluded activities, such as a motorcycling race involving parachuting, how does the policy determine which exclusions take precedence?",
    "What evidence or documentation is required to demonstrate that an activity was not excluded, for example, proving that rock climbing was conducted on a man-made wall rather than natural terrain?",
    "How do the exclusions for sporting activities involving ropes or guides apply to amateur versus professional participants, and does the policy differentiate coverage based on the participant's skill or employment status?",
    "If a policyholder is injured while engaging in an excluded activity but was unaware of the exclusion, how does the policy address claims in such scenarios, and what role do policy disclosures and warnings play?"
