  "content": "Under the insurance policy's Critical Illness Benefit (Section A), the maximum benefit payable for Early Stage and Advanced Stage Critical Illness is 100% of the Sum Insured, with coverage options ranging from S$50,000 to S$300,000.\nAdditionally, under Section A, the benefit for Angioplasty & Other Invasive Treatment for Coronary Artery is 10% of the Sum Insured, with a maximum payout of S$25,000.\nUnder the policy's Extra ICU Benefit (Section B), an additional cash benefit is provided for stays in the ICU for 4 or more consecutive days in one admission. The maximum benefit is 20% of the Sum Insured, up to a maximum of S$25,000. This top-up benefit does not reduce the critical illness cover.",
