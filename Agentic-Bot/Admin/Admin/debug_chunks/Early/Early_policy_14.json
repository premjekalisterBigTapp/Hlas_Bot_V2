  "content": "### POLICY DEFINITIONS\nThis Policy and the Policy Schedule shall be read together as one contract and any word or expression to which a specific meaning has been attached in any part of this policy or of the Policy Schedule shall bear such meaning whenever it may appear.\n\n**\"Accident\"** means a specific event which is sudden, unforeseen and unexpected which occurs during the Period of Insurance.\n\n**\"Benefit Limit\"** means the Maximum Benefit Payable as stated in the Coverage Outline of the Policy Schedule.\n\n**\"Diagnosed\"** means a diagnosis made by the Registered Medical Practitioner, based on radiological, clinical, histological or laboratory evidence accepted by Us. We may appoint another Registered Medical Practitioner to examine the Insured Person or the evidence presented. The opinion and diagnosis of this Registered Medical Practitioner will be binding on the Insured Person and Us.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy ensure consistency in interpretation when a word or expression has a specific meaning in either the Policy or the Policy Schedule, and how does this affect claims processing?",
    "In what ways does the definition of 'Accident' as a sudden, unforeseen, and unexpected event during the Period of Insurance influence the eligibility of claims for incidents occurring outside this period or for gradual injuries?",
    "How does the policy's definition of 'Benefit Limit' as the Maximum Benefit Payable in the Coverage Outline impact the calculation of claim payouts when multiple coverages are involved?",
    "What are the implications of the policy allowing the insurer to appoint another Registered Medical Practitioner to examine the Insured Person or evidence, especially in cases of disputed diagnoses?",
    "How does the binding nature of the appointed Registered Medical Practitioner's opinion and diagnosis affect the resolution of claims involving complex medical conditions or second opinions?",
    "In scenarios where radiological, clinical, histological, or laboratory evidence is ambiguous, how does the policy determine whether a diagnosis is accepted for claim purposes?",
    "How does the requirement that an 'Accident' must be sudden, unforeseen, and unexpected interact with claims related to pre-existing conditions or progressive illnesses?",
    "What documentation standards are implied by the definition of 'Diagnosed' for submitting medical evidence, and how might this affect claims for conditions diagnosed outside the Period of Insurance?",
    "How does the policy treat events that are sudden and unforeseen but occur just outside the Period of Insurance in relation to the 'Accident' definition and claim eligibility?",
    "In cases where the Policy Schedule and the Policy text differ in wording for a term, how does the policy's instruction to read them together as one contract resolve potential conflicts?",
    "How might the definition of 'Benefit Limit' affect claims when the insured incurs expenses exceeding the stated maximum, and what role does the Coverage Outline play in such scenarios?",
    "What are the potential consequences for an insured if the insurer's appointed Registered Medical Practitioner disagrees with the original diagnosis provided by the insured's doctor?",
    "How does the policy's definition of 'Accident' exclude or include incidents caused by gradual exposure or repetitive stress injuries occurring during the Period of Insurance?",
    "In what ways does the policy's definition of 'Diagnosed' ensure that only medically substantiated conditions are covered, and how does this interact with claims for self-reported symptoms?",
    "How does the binding diagnosis clause affect the insured's ability to appeal or provide alternative medical opinions in the claims process?",
    "What is the significance of the policy specifying that the diagnosis must be based on accepted medical evidence, and how does this impact claims involving alternative or experimental diagnostic methods?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where the Coverage Outline's Benefit Limit is ambiguous or not clearly stated in relation to the overall policy definitions?",
    "In the event of a dispute over whether an event qualifies as an 'Accident,' how does the policy's definition guide the adjudication process?",
    "How does the integration of the Policy and Policy Schedule as one contract influence the interpretation of terms that may have different meanings in other insurance documents or prior policies?",
    "What procedures must the insured follow to comply with the policy's requirement for diagnosis by a Registered Medical Practitioner, and how does this affect claims involving overseas medical treatment?"
