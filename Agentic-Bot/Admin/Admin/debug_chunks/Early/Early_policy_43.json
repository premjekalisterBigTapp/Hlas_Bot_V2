    "How does the policy address claims related to self-inflicted injuries or suicide attempts, including distinctions between sane and insane states, and are there any exceptions for acts done to save human life?",
    "In what ways does the policy exclude coverage for injuries or conditions arising from the insured being under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, and how are prescribed medications treated under this exclusion?",
    "What are the implications of the policy's exclusion of any Pre-Existing Conditions on claims for medical treatment during the insured trip, and how might this interact with optional covers if available?",
    "How does the exclusion of medical conditions caused by congenital abnormalities or physical defects present at birth affect claims for related treatments or complications during travel?",
    "What limitations does the policy impose on claims related to organ donation by the insured, and how might this exclusion impact coverage for medical complications arising from such donation?",
    "Under what circumstances does the policy exclude critical illness claims related to AIDS or HIV infection, and what are the specific exceptions for HIV due to blood transfusion or occupational exposure?",
    "How do the general exclusions for self-inflicted injury and intoxication interact with claims for emergency medical evacuation or repatriation services?",
    "If an insured person suffers a critical illness linked indirectly to HIV but not from blood transfusion or occupational exposure, how does the policy handle such claims in light of the exclusions?",
    "Are there any provisions or exceptions in the policy for coverage of injuries sustained while the insured was under the influence of prescribed medication, and how is drug addiction treatment excluded?",
    "How does the policy treat claims arising from congenital abnormalities when these conditions exacerbate during travel, and what documentation might be required to establish the exclusion?",
    "In cases where an insured person attempts suicide but the act was to save another person's life, how does the policy apply the exclusion related to wilful exposure to peril?",
    "What is the policy's stance on claims for critical illnesses that are complicated by HIV/AIDS but originated from other causes, considering the stated exclusions and exceptions?",
    "How might the exclusion of pre-existing conditions affect claims for medical treatment that is a direct consequence of a previously undiagnosed condition discovered during the trip?",
    "Does the policy exclude coverage for injuries or illnesses resulting from the insured's voluntary donation of organs during travel, and how does this exclusion apply to subsequent medical expenses?",
    "How are claims handled if the insured was under the influence of intoxicating liquor but also had a pre-existing medical condition that contributed to the injury or illness?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to demonstrate that a medical condition is due to congenital abnormalities or physical defects present at birth, to apply the exclusion correctly?",
    "In the event of a critical illness claim involving HIV infection, how does the policy differentiate between occupationally acquired HIV and other modes of transmission for coverage purposes?",
    "How does the policy exclusion for self-inflicted injury apply if the insured was temporarily insane or mentally incapacitated at the time of the act?",
    "Are there any scenarios under which the policy would cover injuries or illnesses caused by drug use, considering the exclusion for drugs not prescribed by a Registered Medical Practitioner?",
