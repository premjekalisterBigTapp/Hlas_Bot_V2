  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define end-stage kidney failure in terms of required treatments and what documentation is needed to prove permanent renal dialysis or kidney transplantation?",
    "In cases of end-stage kidney failure, how does the policy address claims if the condition is chronic and irreversible but the insured has not yet started permanent renal dialysis or received a kidney transplant?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if an insured person with end-stage kidney failure undergoes temporary dialysis rather than permanent dialysis or transplantation?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between chronic irreversible kidney failure and other kidney conditions that may require dialysis or transplantation but are not classified as end-stage?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations related to pre-existing end-stage kidney failure conditions, and how do these interact with the requirement for permanent dialysis or transplantation?",
    "If an insured person develops end-stage kidney failure during the trip, what are the timing and notification requirements for claims related to permanent dialysis or kidney transplantation?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for end-stage kidney failure if the insured refuses recommended kidney transplantation but continues with permanent dialysis?",
    "In the event of a kidney transplant, what specific medical reports or proof must be submitted to validate the claim under the end-stage kidney failure definition?",
    "Does the policy provide any coverage for complications arising from permanent renal dialysis or kidney transplantation related to end-stage kidney failure?",
    "How does the policy treat end-stage kidney failure claims if the insured has undergone a prior kidney transplant but now requires permanent dialysis again?",
    "Are there any age restrictions or eligibility criteria for coverage of end-stage kidney failure under this policy, especially concerning permanent dialysis or transplantation?",
    "How does the policy address coverage if the insured’s end-stage kidney failure is due to a pre-existing condition that was not disclosed at the time of policy purchase?",
    "What is the interaction between the general exclusions of the policy and the specific definition of end-stage kidney failure requiring permanent dialysis or transplantation?",
    "If an insured person is diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure but delays treatment, how does this affect the claim for permanent renal dialysis or kidney transplantation?",
    "Does the policy cover the costs of kidney transplantation surgery and post-operative care as part of the end-stage kidney failure benefit, and what documentation is required?",
    "How does the policy define 'permanent' in the context of renal dialysis for end-stage kidney failure, and what evidence is needed to prove permanency?",
    "Are there any exclusions related to experimental or non-standard treatments for end-stage kidney failure, such as alternative dialysis methods or transplant procedures?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for end-stage kidney failure if the insured receives treatment overseas versus in their home country?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the insured’s end-stage kidney failure is caused by an excluded event or condition under the policy’s general exclusions?",
    "In cases where end-stage kidney failure is diagnosed but the insured opts for palliative care instead of permanent dialysis or transplantation, how does the policy respond to claims?"
