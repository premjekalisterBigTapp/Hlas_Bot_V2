  "content": "6.  **Keyhole Coronary Bypass Surgery**\n    The undergoing for the first time for the correction of the narrowing or blockage of one or more coronary arteries with bypass grafts via \"Keyhole\" surgery. The surgery must be considered Medically Necessary by a Specialist. All intra-arterial catheter-based techniques are excluded from this benefit.\n\n7.  **Heart Valve Surgery**\n    This benefit is payable where aortic valve is repaired by percutaneous intravascular balloon valvuloplasty techniques not involving opening up of thoracic cavity by thoracotomy/ mini thoracotomy/ sternotomy.\n\n8.  **Large Asymptomatic Aortic Aneurysm**\n    Large asymptomatic abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection as evidenced by appropriate imaging technique. The aorta must be enlarged greater than 55mm in diameter and the diagnosis must be confirmed by a consultant cardiologist.",
  "questions": [
    "What are the specific medical criteria and specialist requirements for coverage of Keyhole Coronary Bypass Surgery, and how do exclusions of intra-arterial catheter-based techniques affect claim eligibility?",
    "How does the policy define the scope of Heart Valve Surgery coverage in terms of the surgical techniques allowed, and what are the implications of excluding surgeries involving thoracotomy, mini thoracotomy, or sternotomy?",
    "Under what conditions is a Large Asymptomatic Aortic Aneurysm covered, including size thresholds, diagnostic imaging requirements, and confirmation by a consultant cardiologist?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between Keyhole Coronary Bypass Surgery and intra-arterial catheter-based procedures in terms of coverage and exclusions?",
    "What documentation and specialist confirmation are required to prove the medical necessity of Keyhole Coronary Bypass Surgery for a first-time procedure?",
    "In cases of Heart Valve Surgery, how does the use of percutaneous intravascular balloon valvuloplasty techniques without thoracic cavity opening impact the eligibility for benefits?",
    "How does the policy address coverage for aortic aneurysms that are symptomatic versus large asymptomatic aneurysms, and what imaging techniques are considered appropriate?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if aortic valve repair involves surgical methods other than percutaneous intravascular balloon valvuloplasty, such as thoracotomy or sternotomy?",
    "How does the requirement for the aorta to be enlarged greater than 55mm in diameter influence the eligibility for benefits related to Large Asymptomatic Aortic Aneurysm?",
    "What role does the consultant cardiologist's confirmation play in validating claims for Large Asymptomatic Aortic Aneurysm under this policy?",
    "Are repeat or subsequent Keyhole Coronary Bypass Surgeries covered, or is coverage limited strictly to the first-time procedure, and how is this determined?",
    "How does the exclusion of all intra-arterial catheter-based techniques affect patients who undergo minimally invasive coronary procedures that do not qualify as Keyhole Coronary Bypass Surgery?",
    "What are the policy's provisions regarding the timing and documentation of imaging techniques used to diagnose Large Asymptomatic Aortic Aneurysm or aortic dissection?",
    "In what ways do the definitions of 'Keyhole' surgery and 'percutaneous intravascular balloon valvuloplasty' impact the interpretation of covered Heart Valve Surgeries?",
    "How does the policy handle coverage if aortic valve repair surgery initially planned as percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty requires conversion to an open thoracic procedure?",
    "What exclusions apply if a patient undergoes heart valve surgery involving thoracotomy, mini thoracotomy, or sternotomy, and how does this interact with general policy exclusions?",
    "How are claims managed if imaging shows an aortic aneurysm exactly at 55mm diameter, and does the policy specify strict greater-than criteria or allow for borderline cases?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the diagnosis of Large Asymptomatic Aortic Aneurysm is made by a non-consultant cardiologist or without consultant confirmation?",
    "How does the policy define 'Medically Necessary' in the context of Keyhole Coronary Bypass Surgery, and what evidence must a Specialist provide to satisfy this requirement?",
    "Are there any interactions or precedence rules between these specific surgical benefits and any general policy exclusions or limitations that might affect claim approval?"
