  "content": "1.  **Major Cancer**\n    A malignant tumour positively diagnosed with histological confirmation and characterised by the uncontrolled growth of malignant cells with invasion and destruction of normal tissue.\n    The term Major Cancer includes, but is not limited to, leukemia, lymphoma and sarcoma.\n    Major Cancer diagnosed on the basis of finding tumour cells and/or tumour-associated molecules in blood, saliva, faeces, urine or any other bodily fluid in the absence of further definitive and clinically verifiable evidence does not meet the above definition.\n    For the above definition, the following are excluded:\n    * All tumours which are histologically classified as any of the following:\n        * Pre-malignant;\n        * Non-invasive;\n        * Carcinoma-in-situ (Tis) or Ta;\n        * Having borderline malignancy;\n        * Having any degree of malignant potential;\n        * Having suspicious malignancy;\n        * Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behaviour; or",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define Major Cancer in terms of diagnostic methods, and what specific histological confirmations are required to meet this definition?",
    "In what ways do the exclusions related to tumour classification, such as pre-malignant or carcinoma-in-situ, affect the eligibility of a Major Cancer claim under this policy?",
    "How does the policy treat diagnoses based solely on tumour cells or tumour-associated molecules found in bodily fluids without further clinical evidence when determining Major Cancer coverage?",
    "What types of tumours are explicitly excluded from the Major Cancer definition due to their histological classification, and how might this impact claims for borderline or suspicious malignancies?",
    "How does the inclusion of leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma within the Major Cancer definition influence the scope of coverage compared to other malignant tumours?",
    "What documentation or clinical evidence is necessary to differentiate between a malignant tumour covered under Major Cancer and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behaviour that are excluded?",
    "How might the exclusion of non-invasive tumours and those with any degree of malignant potential affect claims arising from early-stage cancer diagnoses?",
    "In cases where a tumour is histologically classified as carcinoma-in-situ (Tis) or Ta, how does the policy's exclusion clause impact the insured's ability to claim Major Cancer benefits?",
    "How does the policy address situations where a tumour initially classified as borderline malignancy later progresses to a malignant state in terms of claim eligibility?",
    "What are the implications of excluding neoplasms with suspicious malignancy from the Major Cancer definition on claims involving ambiguous diagnostic results?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between malignant tumours and pre-malignant conditions in terms of coverage, and what challenges might arise in borderline diagnostic cases?",
    "What role does histological classification play in determining whether a tumour qualifies as Major Cancer, and how might this interact with general policy exclusions related to pre-existing conditions?",
    "How does the policy's definition of Major Cancer interact with any general exclusions related to diseases diagnosed prior to the policy inception or waiting periods?",
    "In the context of Major Cancer claims, how important is the timing and method of diagnosis, especially when relying on histological confirmation versus molecular or fluid-based tests?",
    "How might the exclusion of tumours with any degree of malignant potential affect claims for tumours that are initially indeterminate but later confirmed malignant?",
    "What are the potential challenges in claiming Major Cancer benefits when the diagnosis is based on non-invasive or borderline malignancies that do not meet the policy's definition?",
    "How does the policy ensure clarity in claims involving tumours with uncertain or unknown behaviour, and what evidence would be required to overcome these exclusions?",
    "In what scenarios could a diagnosis of lymphoma or sarcoma be denied coverage under this policy despite being listed as included, based on the exclusions provided?",
    "How does the policy's Major Cancer definition and exclusions align with common medical diagnostic practices, and what implications does this have for insured persons seeking coverage?",
    "What is the impact of excluding carcinoma-in-situ and similar classifications on early detection benefits or preventive treatment claims under this policy?"
