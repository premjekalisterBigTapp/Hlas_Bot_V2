It is hereby expressly stipulated that it shall be a condition precedent to any right of action or suit upon this Policy that an arbitration award shall be first obtained. Unless any such action or suit be commenced within six (6) months of the making of an award, We shall not be liable to make any payment in excess of the amount of the award.",
