  "content": "iv. A credit in favour of Us or the intermediary is made through an electronic medium including the internet.\n    b. In the event that the total premium due is not paid to Us (or the intermediary through whom this Policy or Bond was effected) on or before the inception date or the renewal date, then the insurance shall not attach and no benefits whatsoever shall be payable by Us. Any payment received thereafter shall be of no effect whatsoever as cover has not attached.\n    c. **Premium Payment**\n        i. The payment of the premium when it is due will ensure the continuance of the Policy in force until the next premium is due;\n        ii. This Policy will be renewed upon the payment of the premium when it is due either on a monthly, annual or lump sum basis as applicable and stated in the Policy Schedule unless prior written notice of cancellation has been given in accordance with General Condition 4 or the Policy has otherwise been terminated.",
