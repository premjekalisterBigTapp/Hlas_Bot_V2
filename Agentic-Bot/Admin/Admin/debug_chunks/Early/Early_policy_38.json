  "content": "* The operation or procedure performed via endoscopic or keyhole surgery\n    * The operation or procedure performed via catheterisation\n6.  **Surgery to Aorta**\n    The actual undergoing of major surgery to repair or correct an aneurysm, narrowing, obstruction or dissection of the aorta through surgical opening of the chest or abdomen. For the purpose of this definition, aorta shall mean the thoracic and abdominal aorta but not its branches. Surgery performed using only minimally invasive or intra-arterial techniques are excluded.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define coverage for surgeries performed via endoscopic or keyhole techniques, and are these considered major surgeries eligible for benefits?",
    "In what scenarios would catheterisation procedures be covered or excluded under the policy's surgical benefits?",
    "What specific criteria must a surgery meet to be classified as 'Surgery to Aorta' under this policy, including the anatomical scope and surgical approach?",
    "Are surgeries performed on branches of the aorta covered under the 'Surgery to Aorta' definition, and how does this affect claim eligibility?",
    "How does the policy treat surgeries to the aorta that are performed using minimally invasive or intra-arterial techniques in terms of coverage?",
    "If a surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm is performed via a keyhole surgery approach, does the policy consider this eligible for the 'Surgery to Aorta' benefit?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to demonstrate that a surgery was performed through a surgical opening of the chest or abdomen as defined for 'Surgery to Aorta'?",
    "How does the exclusion of minimally invasive techniques for aortic surgery interact with coverage for other types of surgeries performed via endoscopic methods?",
    "Are there any conditions under which catheterisation procedures might be considered equivalent to surgical procedures for the purposes of this policy?",
    "Does the policy provide any exceptions or special considerations for surgeries involving the thoracic versus the abdominal aorta?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between major surgery and minor procedures when considering coverage for operations involving the aorta?",
    "What implications does the exclusion of intra-arterial techniques have on claims for surgeries intended to correct aortic obstructions?",
    "If a surgery involves both the aorta and its branches, how does the policy determine which parts are covered and which are excluded?",
    "How might the policy's definitions affect coverage if a procedure initially planned as open surgery to the aorta is converted to a minimally invasive technique during the operation?",
    "What are the potential coverage consequences if a procedure is described as catheterisation but involves surgical opening of the chest or abdomen?",
    "How does the policy address surgeries that repair aortic dissections in terms of required surgical approach and coverage eligibility?",
    "Are there any general exclusions in the policy that might override coverage for surgeries defined under this section, such as surgeries performed for elective or cosmetic reasons?",
    "How does the policy's surgical coverage interact with pre-existing condition clauses when the surgery involves the aorta?",
    "What is the policy's stance on surgeries performed emergently versus electively for aortic conditions, especially regarding the surgical approach required for coverage?",
    "In cases where the surgical report is ambiguous about the technique used (open surgery versus minimally invasive), how might the policy determine coverage eligibility for aortic surgery?"
