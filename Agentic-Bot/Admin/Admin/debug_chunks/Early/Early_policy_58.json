If at the correct age, the Insured Person was not eligible to be insured by Us, this Policy will be void from the Effective Date and We will refund the total premium paid from the Effective Date.\n\n20. **Non-Assignment and Discharge**\n    We will not recognize or be affected by any notice of trust, charge or assignment relating to this Policy. The receipt of the Insured Person, or his legal personal representatives or of any person(s) to whom any benefit is expressed to be payable shall in all cases effectively discharge Our liability.",
