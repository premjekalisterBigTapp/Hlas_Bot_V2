  "content": "Q: How does the ICU benefit work?\nA: In the event you are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and treated with continuous life support devices for four (4) consecutive days or more. We will pay 20% of the Benefit Limit, subject to a maximum of $25,000. This benefit can only be claimed once during the period of insurance. The payment of ICU Benefits will not reduce the Benefit Limit amount.",
  "questions": [
    "How is the ICU benefit calculated in terms of percentage and maximum payout when admitted for continuous life support, and how does this affect the overall Benefit Limit?",
    "What are the minimum duration and treatment conditions required for an ICU admission to qualify for the ICU benefit under this policy?",
    "Can the ICU benefit be claimed multiple times within the same period of insurance, and how does this limitation impact coverage planning?",
    "Does the payment of the ICU benefit reduce the overall Benefit Limit available for other claims during the period of insurance?",
    "In the case of ICU admission lasting exactly four consecutive days with continuous life support, what portion of the Benefit Limit is payable and what is the maximum amount?",
    "How does the policy define continuous life support devices for the purpose of qualifying for the ICU benefit, and what documentation might be required to prove this?",

    "What happens if a policyholder is admitted to the ICU multiple times during the period of insurance but never for four consecutive days or more; is any ICU benefit payable?",
    "How does the ICU benefit interact with other medical benefits under the policy, especially regarding the Benefit Limit and potential overlaps?",
    "Are there any exclusions or conditions under which ICU admission with continuous life support would not qualify for the ICU benefit despite meeting the duration requirement?",
    "If the policyholder is admitted to the ICU for five consecutive days but the treatment does not involve continuous life support devices, is the ICU benefit payable?",
    "How does the policy handle ICU benefit claims if the admission spans across two different periods of insurance?",
    "What documentation or proof is typically required to substantiate a claim for the ICU benefit related to continuous life support and duration of stay?",
    "In the event of ICU admission with continuous life support for more than four days, how is the 20% Benefit Limit payment calculated if the total Benefit Limit is less than $125,000?",
    "Does the ICU benefit cover admissions to any intensive care unit globally, or are there geographic or facility-type restrictions implied in the policy?",
    "How does the ICU benefit apply if the insured is admitted to the ICU but the life support devices are used intermittently rather than continuously?",
    "Is the ICU benefit considered a lump sum payment or reimbursed expense, and how does this affect the insured's claims process?",
    "If the insured is admitted to the ICU for continuous life support for four days but the admission is due to a condition excluded under the general exclusions, is the ICU benefit payable?",
    "How does the ICU benefit clause interact with any pre-existing condition exclusions or optional covers that might affect ICU admissions?",
    "In cases where the insured is admitted to the ICU for continuous life support for four days, but the admission is due to a quarantine or COVID-19 related condition, does the policy specify any special considerations or exclusions for the ICU benefit?"
