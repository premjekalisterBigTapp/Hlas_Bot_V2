  "content": "5.  **Open- Heart Heart Valve Surgery**\n    The actual undergoing of open-heart surgery to replace or repair heart valve abnormalities. The diagnosis of heart valve abnormality must be supported by cardiac catheterization or echocardiogram and the procedure must be considered medically necessary by a consultant cardiologist. The open-heart surgery refers to an incision on the heart for the direct visual replacement or repair of the heart valve abnormalities. For the above definition, the following operation or procedures are excluded:\n    * The operation or procedure performed via endoscopic or keyhole surgery\n    * The operation or procedure performed via catheterisation\n6.  **Surgery to Aorta**",
  "questions": [
    "What are the diagnostic requirements and medical necessity conditions that must be met for open-heart heart valve surgery to be covered under the policy?",
    "How does the policy define open-heart surgery for heart valve abnormalities, and what specific surgical approaches are excluded from coverage?",
    "In what ways do the exclusions of endoscopic, keyhole, and catheterisation procedures affect the eligibility for claims related to heart valve surgery?",
    "If a heart valve abnormality is diagnosed without cardiac catheterization or echocardiogram, how does this impact the coverage for open-heart surgery under the policy?",
    "How does the requirement for a consultant cardiologist's medical necessity assessment influence the approval of claims for heart valve surgery?",
    "Are minimally invasive procedures such as keyhole surgery or catheter-based interventions ever covered under this policy section for heart valve abnormalities?",
    "What documentation must be provided to prove that the open-heart surgery involved a direct incision on the heart rather than a less invasive method?",
    "How does the policy treat surgeries on the aorta in relation to open-heart heart valve surgery, and are there any overlapping or distinct coverage conditions?",
    "If a patient undergoes heart valve repair via catheterisation, how does the policy's exclusion clause affect the claim for surgery benefits?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the heart valve surgery is performed without the support of cardiac catheterization or echocardiogram diagnostics?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between open-heart surgery and other cardiac procedures in terms of coverage eligibility and exclusions?",
    "In cases where a consultant cardiologist deems the surgery not medically necessary, how does this affect the claim for open-heart heart valve surgery?",
    "What role does the type of surgical approach (open incision versus endoscopic) play in determining whether the heart valve surgery is covered?",
    "How must the insured demonstrate that the surgery was specifically for replacement or repair of heart valve abnormalities to qualify for coverage?",
    "If a surgery involves both open-heart valve repair and catheterisation, how does the policy apply its exclusions and coverage rules?",
    "Are there any conditions under which the policy might consider coverage for surgeries performed via catheterisation or endoscopic methods despite the stated exclusions?",
    "How does the policy address claims where the surgical procedure was planned as open-heart surgery but converted to a keyhole or catheter-based approach during operation?",
    "What is the significance of the policy specifying that the incision must be on the heart for the surgery to be covered, and how is this verified?",
    "How do the exclusions for certain surgical methods interact with any general policy exclusions related to pre-existing conditions or elective procedures?",
    "In the event of a dispute over whether a procedure qualifies as open-heart surgery under the policy, what evidence or expert opinions are required to resolve the claim?"
