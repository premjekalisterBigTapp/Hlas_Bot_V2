  "content": "**\"ICU\"** means Intensive Care Unit of a Hospital that is dedicated to the management of patients with severe or life-threatening conditions.\n\n**\"Illness\"** means a physical condition contracted marked by pathological deviation from the normal healthy state.\n\n**\"Injury\"** means physical harm to the body caused solely and directly by an Accident and not by sickness, disease or gradual physical or mental wear and tear.\n\n**\"Insured Person\"** means the person described as such in the Policy Schedule.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the definition of 'ICU' as a specialized hospital unit for severe or life-threatening conditions affect the eligibility and documentation requirements for claims related to critical care expenses?",
    "In what ways does the policy distinguish between 'Illness' and 'Injury' when determining coverage, especially considering that 'Injury' must be caused solely and directly by an Accident and not by sickness or gradual wear and tear?",
    "How might the definition of 'Injury' exclude claims arising from conditions that develop gradually or are caused by disease, and what implications does this have for coverage of physical harm?",
    "What are the potential challenges in proving that an 'Injury' was caused solely and directly by an Accident rather than by sickness or gradual deterioration, and how might this affect claim outcomes?",
    "How does the policy define an 'Insured Person,' and what documentation is typically required to verify that a claimant is the person described in the Policy Schedule?",
    "Considering the definitions provided, how would a claim be assessed if a patient is admitted to a hospital but not to an ICU, despite having a severe condition?",
    "How do the definitions of 'Illness' and 'Injury' interact when a physical condition involves both pathological deviation and trauma, and how might this affect the classification of the claim?",
    "What exclusions or limitations might apply if an injury results from a pre-existing illness or a condition that is not sudden but develops over time, given the definitions provided?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for treatment in an ICU when the admission is for monitoring rather than management of severe or life-threatening conditions, based on the ICU definition?",
    "In cases where an insured person suffers from a condition that is both an illness and results in injury, how does the policy determine which coverage applies?",
    "How might the definition of 'Insured Person' impact claims when the policyholder attempts to claim for someone not explicitly named in the Policy Schedule?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if an insured person is admitted to a hospital unit that is not officially designated as an ICU but provides similar critical care services?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between injuries caused by accidents and those caused by sickness or disease in terms of claim eligibility and required evidence?",
    "In what scenarios could the definition of 'Illness' as a pathological deviation from normal health exclude coverage for conditions resulting from mental or emotional factors?",
    "How does the policy address claims where the physical harm is caused indirectly by an accident but also involves underlying sickness or disease?",
    "What documentation or proof might be necessary to establish that a hospital unit qualifies as an ICU under the policy's definition for claim purposes?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for injuries that occur gradually over time but are related to an accident event, considering the definition of 'Injury'?",
    "What role does the definition of 'Insured Person' play in multi-person policies or family plans when determining who is covered for ICU or injury-related claims?",
    "How might the policy's definitions affect coverage for conditions that require ICU admission due to complications from an illness rather than a direct injury?",
    "In the context of these definitions, how are claims handled when an insured person suffers physical harm that is partially caused by an accident and partially by pre-existing illness?"
