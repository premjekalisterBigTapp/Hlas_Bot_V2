  "content": "3.  **Pericardiectomy**\n    The undergoing of a pericardiectomy or undergoing of any surgical procedure requiring keyhole cardiac surgery as a result of pericardial diseases. Both these surgical procedures must be certified to be absolutely necessary by a consultant cardiologist.\n\n4.  **Brain Aneurysm Surgery**\n    The actual undergoing of surgical repair of an intracranial aneurysm or surgical removal of an arterio-venous malformation via craniotomy. The surgical intervention must be certified to be absolutely necessary by a Specialist in the relevant field. Endovascular repair or procedures are not covered.\n\n5.  **Cerebral Shunt Insertion**\n    The actual undergoing of surgical implantation of a shunt from the ventricles of the brain to relieve raised pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid. The need of a shunt must be certified to be absolutely necessary by a Specialist in the relevant field.",
  "questions": [
    "What are the certification requirements by medical specialists for coverage of pericardiectomy, brain aneurysm surgery, and cerebral shunt insertion under this policy?",
    "How does the policy define the necessity of keyhole cardiac surgery for pericardial diseases in relation to coverage eligibility?",
    "In what ways does the policy exclude endovascular repair procedures from coverage when claiming for brain aneurysm surgery?",
    "What specific surgical procedures related to brain aneurysms are covered, and how must their necessity be established for a valid claim?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between surgical repair of intracranial aneurysms and surgical removal of arterio-venous malformations in terms of coverage?",
    "What documentation or certification must a specialist provide to confirm the absolute necessity of cerebral shunt insertion for raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure?",
    "Are there any limitations or exclusions related to the type of surgical approach (e.g., keyhole vs. open surgery) for pericardiectomy under this policy?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for surgical procedures that are similar but not explicitly listed, such as endovascular procedures for brain aneurysms?",
    "What conditions must be met for the policy to cover the surgical implantation of a cerebral shunt, and who must certify these conditions?",
    "How does the policy address the necessity and certification of surgical procedures performed for pericardial diseases compared to those for brain aneurysms or cerebrospinal fluid pressure?",
    "What role does the consultant cardiologist play in certifying the necessity of pericardiectomy or keyhole cardiac surgery for coverage eligibility?",
    "How does the policy ensure that only surgeries deemed absolutely necessary by specialists are covered, and what impact does this have on claims for elective or non-essential procedures?",
    "Are there any specific exclusions or conditions related to the timing or urgency of brain aneurysm surgery or cerebral shunt insertion for coverage?",
    "How does the policy treat surgical procedures that involve minimally invasive techniques versus traditional open surgeries in the context of pericardiectomy and brain aneurysm repair?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a surgical procedure for an intracranial aneurysm is performed without certification from a relevant specialist?",
    "How does the policy define the scope of 'specialist in the relevant field' for certifying brain aneurysm surgery and cerebral shunt insertion?",
    "What evidence or reports must be submitted to prove the absolute necessity of the surgical procedures listed, and how might this affect claim processing times?",
    "How does the exclusion of endovascular repair procedures for brain aneurysms interact with general policy exclusions or other surgical procedure coverages?",
    "In cases where multiple surgical interventions are required (e.g., both pericardiectomy and cerebral shunt insertion), how does the policy address certification and coverage?",
    "What are the potential consequences for claims if the surgical procedure is performed but the certification of absolute necessity by the appropriate specialist is missing or incomplete?"
