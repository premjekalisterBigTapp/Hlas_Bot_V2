    "How does the definition of 'Medically Necessary' incorporate the requirements for clinical appropriateness, accepted medical standards, and specialty society recommendations when determining coverage eligibility for medical treatments?",
    "In what ways does the policy define the 'Period of Insurance' and how does cancellation or termination affect the validity of coverage within this period?",
    "How is the term 'Permanent' applied in the context of medical conditions, and what implications does it have for claims related to long-term or lifelong health issues?",
    "What criteria must a medical treatment meet to be considered 'Medically Necessary' under this policy, and how might these criteria affect claims for experimental or non-standard procedures?",
    "How does the policy ensure that treatments align with the Registered Medical Practitioner's specialty society recommendations and established clinical protocols, and what documentation might be required to prove this?",
    "How does the definition of 'Insured Person' limit coverage to individuals specifically named in the Policy Schedule, and what are the implications for family members or additional travelers not listed?",
    "In the event of a claim for ongoing medical treatment, how does the policy's definition of 'Medically Necessary' address the frequency and duration of such treatments to determine coverage?",
    "What is the significance of the 'Period of Insurance' ending on the Expiry Date, and how might claims be affected if treatment or incidents occur after this date?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between temporary and 'Permanent' medical conditions, and what impact does this have on the scope of benefits or exclusions?",

    "How might the requirement that medical services be 'clinically appropriate' in terms of site and extent affect coverage for treatments performed outside standard locations or involving extensive procedures?",

    "How does the policy handle situations where the 'Insured Person' designation is ambiguous or disputed, especially in cases involving dependents or travelers sharing a policy?",
    "In what ways could the definition of 'Permanent' influence claims related to disabilities or chronic illnesses that develop during the 'Period of Insurance'?",

    "What documentation or evidence might be required to demonstrate that a medical treatment meets the policy's criteria for being 'Medically Necessary'?",
    "How does the policy ensure that coverage is only provided within the 'Period of Insurance,' and what exceptions, if any, exist for treatments initiated before but continuing after the Expiry Date?",
    "How does the policy's terminology regarding 'Permanent' conditions interact with potential exclusions for pre-existing conditions or optional cover extensions?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a medical treatment is deemed necessary by a practitioner but conflicts with the policy's requirement for adherence to generally accepted standards of medical practice?",
