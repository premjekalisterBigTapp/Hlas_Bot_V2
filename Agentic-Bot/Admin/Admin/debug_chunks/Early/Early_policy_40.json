  "content": "8.  **Angioplasty & Other Invasive Treatment For Coronary Artery**\n    The actual undergoing of balloon angioplasty or similar intra-arterial catheter procedure to correct a narrowing of minimum sixty percent (60%) stenosis, of one or more major coronary arteries as shown by angiographic evidence. The revascularisation must be considered medically necessary by a consultant cardiologist. Coronary arteries herein refer to left main stem, left anterior descending, circumflex and right coronary artery. Payment under this condition is limited to ten percent (10%) of the Benefit Limit under this policy subject to an $25,000 maximum sum payable. This benefit is payable once only and shall be deducted from the amount of this Policy, thereby reducing the amount of the Benefit Limit which may be payable herein. Diagnostic angiography is excluded.",
  "questions": [
    "What are the specific medical criteria, including the minimum percentage of arterial stenosis and required diagnostic evidence, for coverage of angioplasty and similar invasive coronary artery treatments under this policy?",
    "How does the policy define the coronary arteries eligible for angioplasty coverage, and what role does the consultant cardiologist's assessment play in determining medical necessity?",
    "What is the maximum sum payable for angioplasty and other invasive coronary artery treatments, and how does this limit relate to the overall Benefit Limit of the policy?",
    "How does the policy handle the payment of angioplasty benefits in terms of frequency and impact on the remaining Benefit Limit available for other claims?",
    "Are diagnostic angiography procedures covered under this policy, and how does their exclusion affect claims related to coronary artery conditions?",
    "In the event of multiple angioplasty procedures on different coronary arteries, how does the policy limit the number of claims and total payout for these invasive treatments?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between balloon angioplasty and other intra-arterial catheter procedures for coverage eligibility, and what documentation is required to prove the procedure performed?",
    "What conditions must be met for the revascularisation procedure to be considered medically necessary, and how is this necessity verified within the claims process?",
    "If a policyholder undergoes angioplasty for a coronary artery with less than 60% stenosis, how does the policy address coverage eligibility and potential claim denial?",
    "How does the 10% Benefit Limit payment cap for angioplasty interact with other benefits under the policy, and what happens if the angioplasty cost exceeds the $25,000 maximum sum?",
    "What are the implications for the Benefit Limit after an angioplasty claim is paid, and how does this affect subsequent claims under the policy?",
    "Does the policy cover angioplasty procedures performed on coronary arteries not explicitly listed (e.g., smaller branches), and how is coverage determined in such cases?",
    "How does the policy treat angioplasty procedures deemed not medically necessary by a consultant cardiologist, and what documentation is required to support or contest such determinations?",
    "In cases where angioplasty is performed as part of a broader cardiac treatment involving multiple procedures, how does the policy allocate benefits and apply exclusions?",
    "What is the process for submitting claims for angioplasty and other invasive coronary artery treatments, including required medical reports and angiographic evidence?",
    "How does the policy address angioplasty treatments performed outside the insured’s home country, and are there any additional documentation or approval requirements?",
    "If a policyholder has a pre-existing coronary artery condition requiring angioplasty, how does this affect coverage eligibility and benefit limits under the policy?",
    "How does the exclusion of diagnostic angiography impact the overall coverage for coronary artery conditions, especially when angiography is performed prior to angioplasty?",
    "What are the policy implications if angioplasty is performed on a coronary artery with borderline stenosis (e.g., exactly 60%), and how is the percentage stenosis verified?",
    "How does the once-only payment provision for angioplasty benefits interact with policy renewals or extensions, and can a policyholder claim angioplasty benefits again after a new policy period?"
