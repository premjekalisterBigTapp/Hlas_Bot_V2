  "content": "The following are excluded:\n    * Transient Ischaemic Attacks;\n    * Brain damage due to an accident or injury. infection, vasculitis, and inflammatory disease;\n    * Vascular disease affecting the eye or optic nerve;\n    * Ischaemic disorders of the vestibular system; and\n    * Secondary haemorrhage within a pre-existing cerebral lesion.\n\n4.  **Coronary Artery By-pass Surgery**\n    The actual undergoing of open-chest surgery or Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass surgery to correct the narrowing or blockage of one or more coronary arteries with bypass grafts. This diagnosis must be supported by angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery obstruction and the procedure must be considered medically necessary by a consultant cardiologist.\n    Angioplasty and all other intra-arterial, catheter based techniques, 'keyhole' or laser procedures are excluded.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define the eligibility criteria for coverage of Coronary Artery By-pass Surgery, including required medical evidence and consultant cardiologist approval, and how are angioplasty and other catheter-based procedures treated under this section?",
    "In what ways are transient ischaemic attacks excluded from coverage, and how does this exclusion interact with claims related to brain damage caused by accidents, infections, vasculitis, or inflammatory diseases?",
    "What specific vascular conditions affecting the eye or optic nerve are excluded, and how might these exclusions impact claims involving neurological or ocular complications?",
    "How are ischaemic disorders of the vestibular system treated under the policy, and what documentation or medical evidence would be necessary to distinguish covered conditions from these exclusions?",
    "What is the policy stance on secondary haemorrhage occurring within a pre-existing cerebral lesion, and how does this exclusion affect claims involving complications from prior brain injuries?",
    "If a claimant undergoes a minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery, what angiographic evidence and medical necessity criteria must be met for the claim to be valid, and how does this differ from coverage for other cardiac procedures?",
    "How does the exclusion of angioplasty and other intra-arterial, catheter-based, 'keyhole', or laser procedures affect claims for less invasive cardiac treatments, and what alternatives are covered under the policy?",
    "In cases where brain damage results from an accident, how does the policy distinguish between excluded causes such as infection or inflammatory disease and covered accidental injuries?",
    "What documentation or medical reports are required to prove that coronary artery bypass surgery was medically necessary and supported by angiographic evidence, and how might the absence of such documentation affect claim outcomes?",
    "How do the exclusions related to vascular diseases of the eye or optic nerve interact with general exclusions in the policy, and can any exceptions apply under specific circumstances?",
    "If a claimant experiences a transient ischaemic attack followed by a coronary artery bypass surgery, how would the policy handle coverage given the exclusions and definitions provided?",
    "What are the implications of excluding ischaemic disorders of the vestibular system for claims involving dizziness or balance issues potentially linked to cardiovascular conditions?",
    "How does the policy treat brain damage caused by vasculitis or inflammatory disease differently from brain damage caused by trauma, and what evidence is needed to support a claim in either case?",
    "Are there any conditions under which angioplasty or catheter-based cardiac procedures might be considered for coverage despite the stated exclusions, such as emergency interventions or complications?",
    "How does the policy define 'medically necessary' in the context of coronary artery bypass surgery, and what role does the consultant cardiologist's opinion play in claim approval?",
    "In the event of a secondary haemorrhage within a pre-existing cerebral lesion, what exclusions apply, and how might this affect claims related to stroke or brain hemorrhage?",
    "How do the exclusions for specific neurological and vascular conditions affect the overall scope of coverage for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events under this policy?",
    "What are the potential challenges in proving angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery obstruction, and how might this impact the approval of claims for bypass surgery?",
    "How does the policy address claims involving brain damage due to infection or inflammatory disease when these conditions overlap with accidental injury scenarios?",
    "What is the significance of excluding 'keyhole' or laser procedures in the context of coronary artery treatments, and how might this influence a claimant's choice of medical intervention?"
