  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define coverage for cancellation due to industrial action, and what specific conditions must be met regarding the timing and nature of the strike or riot for a claim to be valid?",
    "In what ways does the policy distinguish between different types of civil disturbances such as riot, uprising, or military power in relation to trip cancellation coverage?",
    "What are the requirements for cancellation claims related to flight disruptions caused by airport, runway, or airspace closures, and how do adverse weather conditions factor into these provisions?",
    "How does the policy handle cancellations when a Travel Alert is issued for the planned destination, and what documentation or timing conditions apply to such claims?",
    "If a scheduled Common Carrier service is canceled due to a strike lasting less than 24 hours, is the cancellation covered under this policy, and how does this interact with general exclusions?",
    "What is the interplay between cancellation coverage for industrial action and any general policy exclusions related to known events or travel advisories?",
    "How are cancellations due to adverse weather conditions differentiated from cancellations due to other external events like strikes or civil commotion in terms of claim eligibility and required proof?",
    "In the event of a flight cancellation caused by airport closure, what evidence must the insured provide to substantiate the claim, and how does the timing of the cancellation relative to the itinerary affect coverage?",
    "Does the policy provide coverage if a Travel Alert is issued after the trip has commenced, and how does this timing influence the ability to claim for trip cancellation or curtailment?",
    "How does the policy define a 'Common Carrier' in the context of cancellation coverage, and what implications does this have for trips involving multiple modes of transportation?",
    "What exclusions might override the coverage for cancellations due to strikes or industrial actions, especially if such events were publicly known before the policy was purchased?",
    "How does the policy address cancellations caused by civil commotion that escalates to military or usurped power, and are such scenarios excluded from coverage?",
    "In cases where a flight is canceled due to adverse weather but the airline offers an alternative flight within 24 hours, how does this affect the insured's right to claim under the cancellation provisions?",
    "What documentation is required to prove that a flight was grounded due to airspace closure, and how does this differ from cancellations caused by carrier operational decisions?",
    "How does the policy treat cancellations resulting from Travel Alerts issued for destinations with ongoing public health concerns, and are there any specific exclusions or conditions related to pandemics?",
    "If a strike causes cancellation of a Common Carrier service but the insured had pre-existing medical conditions, how might optional covers or general exclusions impact the claim?",
    "What is the policy's stance on cancellations due to industrial actions or riots that occur in transit locations rather than the final destination, and how does this affect coverage?",
    "How do the cancellation provisions interact with any requirements for the insured to notify the insurer within a certain timeframe after the event causing cancellation?",
    "Are cancellations due to adverse weather conditions covered if the insured voluntarily chooses not to travel despite the flight not being officially canceled, and how does this relate to policy exclusions?",
    "How does the policy coordinate coverage for trip cancellation when multiple causes occur simultaneously, such as a Travel Alert coinciding with a strike affecting the Common Carrier service?"
