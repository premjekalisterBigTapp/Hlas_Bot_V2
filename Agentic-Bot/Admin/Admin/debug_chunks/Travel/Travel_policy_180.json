  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address claims related to self-inflicted injuries or suicide attempts, and are there any exceptions or conditions under which such claims might be considered?",
    "In what ways are pregnancy-related conditions, including miscarriage, childbirth, abortion, and fertility treatments, excluded from coverage, and how might complications affect claim eligibility?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the insured is under the influence of alcohol or non-prescribed drugs during an incident, and how does the policy treat prescribed medications differently?",
    "How does the exclusion for voluntary exposure to needless peril apply, and are there exceptions such as attempts to save human life that might override this exclusion?",
    "What specific exclusions apply to diseases related to HIV, AIDS, and their mutant derivatives, and how does this affect claims for illnesses caused by these conditions?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where the insured proceeds with travel against medical advice, and what documentation is required to establish this exclusion?",
    "How are epidemics and pandemics generally excluded from coverage, and what are the specific exceptions related to COVID-19 under the referenced sections of the policy?",
    "In cases where a trip is undertaken despite a medical professional's advice, how does this interact with other exclusions such as pre-existing conditions or emergency medical coverage?",
    "What documentation or proof is necessary to demonstrate that intoxicating liquor or drug use was under prescription and not for addiction treatment to avoid exclusion under this clause?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between general exclusions for pandemics and the specific COVID-19 coverage provided, and what limitations or conditions apply to the latter?",
    "If a claim involves complications from assisted conception operations, how does the exclusion for fertility and sub-fertility treatments impact the claim's validity?",
    "Under what circumstances might the exclusion for venereal diseases and HIV-related illnesses be contested or require additional evidence to confirm applicability?",
    "How does the exclusion for self-inflicted injury interact with mental health conditions, and are there any provisions for coverage in cases of accidental harm during such episodes?",
    "What are the consequences for claims if the insured voluntarily exposes themselves to danger during the trip, and how is 'needless peril' defined or interpreted in the policy?",
    "How do the exclusions related to intoxicating liquor and drug use affect claims for accidents or illnesses occurring while the insured was impaired, and are there any exceptions for prescribed medication side effects?",
    "In the event of a pandemic declared by the WHO or Singapore's Ministry of Health, how does the policy distinguish between general exclusions and the sections that provide COVID-19 coverage?",
    "How does the policy address claims arising from pregnancy complications that occur unexpectedly during the trip, given the broad exclusion of pregnancy-related conditions?",
    "What is the impact of the exclusion for proceeding with the trip against medical advice on trip cancellation or curtailment claims, and how must the advice be documented?",
    "How are mutant derivatives or variations of HIV and AIDS defined within the policy, and what challenges might arise in proving exclusion applicability for related illnesses?",
    "In cases where the insured attempts to save human life and exposes themselves to peril, how does the policy treat claims that would otherwise be excluded under voluntary exposure to needless peril?"
