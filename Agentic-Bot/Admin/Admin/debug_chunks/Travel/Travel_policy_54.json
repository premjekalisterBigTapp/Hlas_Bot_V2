  "content": "**\"Loss of one Limb\"** means loss by physical severance of a hand at or above the wrist or of a foot at or above the ankle, or permanent and total loss of use of a hand or foot.\n\n**\"Major Burns\"** means Third Degree Burns (destruction of the skin to its full depth and damage to the tissues beneath) with burnt areas equal to or greater than twenty percent (20%) of Your total body surface area or five percent (5%) of the surface area of Your head, provided that the assessment of the burns is certified by a Registered Medical Practitioner with medical reports and full diagnosis.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define 'Loss of one Limb' in terms of physical severance locations and permanent loss of use, and what documentation is required to prove such loss?",
    "What specific criteria must be met for burns to qualify as 'Major Burns' under the policy, including the percentage of body surface area affected and the depth of the burns?",
    "In cases of 'Major Burns,' what role does certification by a Registered Medical Practitioner play, and what types of medical documentation are necessary to support a claim?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between loss of a limb by physical severance versus permanent and total loss of use, and are both equally covered under the same terms?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the burn area is exactly 20% of the total body surface area but less than 5% of the head surface area, or vice versa?",
    "How might the policy handle a claim where the loss of limb is partial but does not meet the threshold of severance at or above the wrist or ankle?",
    "What exclusions or limitations might apply if the medical reports for 'Major Burns' do not include a full diagnosis or certification by a Registered Medical Practitioner?",
    "In the event of a claim for 'Loss of one Limb,' how is the permanent and total loss of use medically determined and documented?",
    "Are there any conditions under which the loss of a finger or toe would be covered or excluded based on the definitions provided for 'Loss of one Limb'?",
    "How does the policy address the timing of medical certification and reporting for both 'Loss of one Limb' and 'Major Burns' to ensure claim validity?",
    "What are the potential challenges in proving 'Major Burns' when the affected area is near the threshold percentages, and how does the policy require these to be resolved?",
    "How does the policy treat cases where the burn severity is less than third degree but the affected area exceeds the specified percentages for 'Major Burns'?",
    "In situations where multiple limbs are affected but only one meets the definition of loss, how does the policy apply the 'Loss of one Limb' definition and coverage?",
    "What is the significance of specifying the severance location at or above the wrist or ankle in the definition of 'Loss of one Limb' for claim eligibility?",
    "How does the policy ensure that the assessment of burns is objective and consistent, and what standards must the Registered Medical Practitioner follow?",
    "Are there any interactions between the definitions of 'Loss of one Limb' and 'Major Burns' that affect the overall benefit limits or claim procedures?",
    "How does the policy handle claims where the loss of limb or burns occur due to excluded causes under the general policy exclusions?",
    "What documentation or evidence is required to differentiate between temporary loss of use and permanent and total loss of use of a limb for claim purposes?",
    "How might the policy address claims involving burns on parts of the body other than the head when the affected area is less than 20% but still severe?",
    "In the context of this policy, how are the terms 'physical severance' and 'permanent and total loss of use' medically defined and verified for claims involving limb loss?"
