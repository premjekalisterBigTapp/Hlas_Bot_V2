    "How do general policy exclusions interact with the Flight Overbooked and Flight Diversion sections, particularly in cases where the overbooking or diversion results from events excluded elsewhere in the policy?",
    "In cases where a flight is both overbooked and subsequently diverted, how does the policy coordinate benefits between Section 25 and Section 26, and can the insured claim under both sections for the same incident?",
    "What constitutes a ‘confirmed scheduled Flight’ under the Flight Overbooked section, and how does this definition impact claims if the flight was rescheduled or delayed prior to boarding?",
    "Are there any age restrictions or pre-existing condition considerations that affect eligibility for benefits under the Flight Overbooked or Flight Diversion sections?",
    "How does the policy address situations where the insured is denied boarding due to overbooking but voluntarily gives up their seat in exchange for compensation from the airline—does this affect the claim under Section 25?",

    "In cases where the insured experiences multiple overbooked flights within the same trip, how does the policy apply the benefit limits and payment calculations under Section 25?",
    "What are the implications of the policy’s requirement for written verification on claims involving chartered flights or non-Common Carrier operators, and are such flights covered under the Flight Overbooked section?",
    "How does the policy address scenarios where the insured is denied boarding due to overbooking but is accommodated on a later flight operated by a different carrier, and does this affect the compensation eligibility or amount?",
