  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define the eligibility for travel postponement benefits when the postponement arises from death, serious bodily injury, or serious sickness affecting you, your travel companion, or an immediate family member during the period of insurance, and what documentation is required to prove these conditions?",
    "In what circumstances related to legal obligations such as witness summons or jury service, which were not known before booking the trip, does the travel postponement coverage apply, and how does this interact with any general exclusions in the policy?",
    "How does compulsory quarantine of you or your travel companion trigger travel postponement benefits, and what conditions or documentation must be met to validate such a claim under this section?",
    "What are the conditions under which serious damage to your home in Singapore caused by natural disaster, fire, or burglary within 14 days before the scheduled departure date qualifies for travel postponement coverage, and how does the insurer’s sole discretion in determining 'serious damage' affect claim approval?",
    "How does the timing of the serious damage to your home relative to the scheduled departure date and the period of insurance affect eligibility for travel postponement benefits, and what proof is required to substantiate the claim?",
    "What is the maximum benefit limit payable for reasonable administrative charges under travel postponement, and how are these charges defined or verified by the insurer?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where multiple reasons for postponement occur simultaneously, such as serious sickness and compulsory quarantine, in terms of benefit eligibility and claim processing?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations specific to travel postponement claims arising from events that were publicly known or foreseeable at the time of booking, and how do these interact with the general policy exclusions?",
    "How does the policy address postponement claims if the travel companion or immediate family member’s condition leading to postponement is a pre-existing condition, and is optional cover required for such claims?",
    "What documentation or evidence is required to prove that a witness summons or jury service was not known to you before the trip was booked, and how does this affect the validity of a travel postponement claim?",
    "In cases of compulsory quarantine causing trip postponement, how does the policy define quarantine, and are there any exclusions related to quarantine due to pandemics or government-imposed travel restrictions?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between postponement due to serious damage to your home and damage that is considered minor or not serious, and what role does the insurer’s discretion play in this determination?",
    "If the postponement is due to serious damage to your home caused by burglary, what proof is required, and how does the timing of the burglary relative to the trip’s scheduled departure date affect claim eligibility?",
    "How does the policy coordinate travel postponement benefits with other sections that may cover trip cancellation or curtailment, especially when the cause of postponement overlaps with those sections?",
    "What are the implications if the postponement occurs outside the period of insurance or if the event causing postponement occurs before the policy inception date?",
    "How does the policy define 'Immediate Family Member' in the context of travel postponement claims, and how does this definition affect who can trigger coverage under this section?",
    "Are administrative charges incurred due to postponement covered if they are not legally payable by you but are voluntarily paid, and how does the policy verify the reasonableness of such charges?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for postponement if the trip was booked through a third party or travel agent, and the administrative charges are imposed by them rather than directly by the carrier or service provider?",
    "In the event of a claim for travel postponement due to serious sickness or injury, how does the policy address the timing of medical certification and the requirement that the condition occurs during the period of insurance?",
    "How do general policy exclusions related to pandemics, government travel advisories, or known events prior to booking interact with the travel postponement coverage, particularly for quarantine or serious damage claims?"
