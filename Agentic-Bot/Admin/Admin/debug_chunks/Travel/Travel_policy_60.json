  "questions": [
    "How does the definition of 'Sickness' determine coverage eligibility when a medical condition manifests suddenly during the Trip but is related to a Pre-Existing Medical Condition, and what documentation from a Registered Medical Practitioner is required to support the claim?",

    "How does the policy define the maximum duration allowed for a Single Return Trip, and what are the implications for coverage if the Trip exceeds one hundred and eighty-two (182) consecutive days within the Period of Insurance?",
    "What conditions must be met for a Trip to qualify as a Single Return Trip under the policy, including the relationship between the selected Country or Area of Travel and the Period of Insurance?",

    "If a medical condition arises during the Trip that requires treatment by a Specialist in a specific field such as neurology or orthopaedics, how does the policy determine whether this treatment is covered under the definition of Sickness?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for medical conditions that commence during the Trip but are related to a Pre-Existing Medical Condition, considering the definition of Sickness and any applicable exclusions?",
    "What is the significance of the requirement that the Sickness must be sudden and unexpected in order to be covered, and how might this affect claims for conditions with gradual onset during the Trip?",
    "How does the policy ensure that treatment by a Registered Medical Practitioner is necessary for the Sickness, and what evidence or documentation might be required to prove this?",

    "How does the policy handle coverage if a Trip is interrupted or extended beyond 182 consecutive days, given the definition of Single Return Trip and its duration limits?",
    "In what ways might the definition of Specialist influence the approval of claims for diagnostic methods or preventive treatments during the Trip, and are there any limitations on which Specialists’ treatments are covered?",
