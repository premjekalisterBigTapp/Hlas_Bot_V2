  "content": "3.  For any treatment performed or ordered by a person who is not a Registered Medical Practitioner.\n4.  For any surgery or medical treatment which, in the opinion of the Registered Medical Practitioner, can be reasonably delayed until Your return to Singapore or arrival in the country of final destination for travellers not returning to Singapore.\n5.  If You are tested positive for any mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 diagnostic test prior to Your Trip.\n6.  If You are not Fully Vaccinated.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy handle claims for medical treatment or surgery that a Registered Medical Practitioner deems reasonably delayable until the insured's return to Singapore or arrival at the final destination, especially in relation to treatment performed overseas?",
    "In what scenarios would treatment or surgery ordered by a non-Registered Medical Practitioner be excluded from coverage, and how does this interact with the requirement for documentation from a Registered Medical Practitioner?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the insured tests positive for a mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 diagnostic test before the trip, considering both quarantine and treatment benefits?",
    "How does the policy define 'Fully Vaccinated' for the purposes of coverage eligibility, and what exclusions apply if the insured is not Fully Vaccinated at the time of travel?",
    "If a traveller is not Fully Vaccinated and tests positive for COVID-19 before departure, how do these two exclusions collectively affect the ability to claim for trip cancellation or medical expenses?",
    "How does the exclusion of treatment ordered by non-Registered Medical Practitioners affect claims for alternative or complementary medicine received overseas during the trip?",
    "In cases where surgery is recommended but can be delayed until after the trip, how does the policy determine whether immediate treatment is covered or excluded, and what documentation is required to support this?",
    "What are the coverage consequences if a traveller undergoes surgery overseas that a Registered Medical Practitioner later states could have been delayed until return, especially if the surgery was urgent at the time?",
    "How does the policy address claims related to COVID-19 if the insured fails to meet vaccination requirements but seeks treatment during the trip?",
    "If a traveller tests positive for a mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 test but proceeds with the trip regardless, how does this affect coverage for medical treatment and trip interruption benefits?",
    "How do the exclusions related to vaccination status and pre-departure COVID-19 test results interact with general policy exclusions for pandemics or epidemics?",
    "What documentation must be provided to prove that a medical treatment or surgery could not be reasonably delayed, in order to overcome the exclusion for delayable treatments?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for medical treatment ordered by a Registered Medical Practitioner but administered by a non-Registered Medical Practitioner, such as a nurse or therapist?",
    "In the event of a positive mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 test, what are the implications for trip cancellation claims and are there any exceptions to this exclusion?",
    "How does the policy define the timing and validity of the mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 diagnostic test in relation to trip commencement and coverage eligibility?",
    "If a traveller is partially vaccinated or has exemptions from vaccination, how does the policy apply the exclusion for not being Fully Vaccinated?",
    "How do these exclusions affect claims for emergency medical evacuation or repatriation if the insured is not Fully Vaccinated or tests positive before departure?",
    "What is the precedence of these specific exclusions (non-Registered Medical Practitioner treatment, delayable surgery, positive pre-departure COVID-19 test, and vaccination status) over general policy exclusions?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for medical treatment related to COVID-19 contracted during the trip if the insured was Fully Vaccinated but tested positive before departure?",
    "In cases where surgery is performed overseas and the insured returns to Singapore for follow-up treatment, how do these exclusions impact coverage for both overseas and Singapore-based medical expenses?"
