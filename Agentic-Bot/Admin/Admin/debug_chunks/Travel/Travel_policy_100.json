  "questions": [
    "How does the requirement to notify the travel agent, tour operator, or transport/accommodation provider immediately after deciding to cancel or curtail a trip affect the eligibility for claims, and what are the consequences of failing to do so?",
    "What are the implications of purchasing this policy less than three days before the scheduled trip commencement on coverage for covered events, and how does this limitation interact with other policy provisions?",
    "In what ways does coverage exclusion apply when the loss is already covered by other insurance schemes, government programs, or when refunds are provided by hotels, Common Carriers, travel agents, or other travel/accommodation providers, and how should claimants document such overlaps?",
    "How does the exclusion of epidemics or pandemics declared by the World Health Organisation or Singapore’s Ministry of Health impact claims related to trip cancellation, curtailment, or other benefits, especially in the context of COVID-19 or similar events?",
    "What are the effects of using air miles, holiday points, membership rewards, or credit card redemptions to pay for part or all of the trip on the policy’s coverage and claim reimbursement?",
    "If a traveler cancels a trip due to a covered event but fails to notify the travel agent immediately, how does this failure interact with the policy’s general exclusions and affect the claim outcome?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for losses arising from events occurring within three days of policy purchase, and are there any exceptions or extensions that might apply in such scenarios?",
    "When a loss is partially covered by another insurance or government program and partially by this policy, how should the claimant coordinate benefits, and what documentation is required to prove the extent of coverage from other sources?",
    "In the event of a pandemic declared by WHO or Singapore’s Ministry of Health, are there any specific conditions under which claims might still be considered, or is the exclusion absolute regardless of circumstances?",
    "How does the use of loyalty points or credit card redemptions as payment methods affect the calculation of reimbursable amounts under the policy, and are there any documentation requirements to verify the payment method?",
    "What is the interplay between the immediate notification requirement and the timing of cancellation or curtailment in determining claim validity, especially if the traveler delays notification due to extenuating circumstances?",
    "If a traveler purchases the policy two days before the trip and experiences a covered event, how does the policy exclusion for late purchase affect claims for trip cancellation, and are any benefits still payable for other sections?",
    "How does the policy define and handle situations where a hotel or Common Carrier provides a refund for a loss, and what impact does this have on the insured’s ability to claim under this policy?",
    "In cases where a government program provides compensation for travel disruption, how does this policy’s exclusion for overlapping coverage affect the insured’s claim, and what proof is required to demonstrate such compensation?",
    "Does the exclusion of epidemics or pandemics declared by official health authorities override any optional covers or extensions related to infectious diseases, and how should insured persons interpret this exclusion in the context of travel disruptions?",
    "When a trip is paid partially with air miles and partially with cash, how does the policy apply the exclusion related to air miles usage, and what portion of the trip cost is eligible for reimbursement?",
    "If a traveler fails to notify the travel provider immediately but can prove that notification was made within a reasonable time frame, how might the insurer assess the claim in light of this exclusion?",
    "How does the policy address claims for losses arising from events occurring during a trip purchased less than three days prior, particularly if the event was unforeseen and sudden?",
    "What documentation should a claimant provide to demonstrate that a loss is not covered by any other insurance or government program, and how does this affect the claim process?",
    "In the context of this policy, how are refunds or reimbursements from travel agents or providers coordinated with claim payments, and what happens if the insured receives duplicate payments?"
