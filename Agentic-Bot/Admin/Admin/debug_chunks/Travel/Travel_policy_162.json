  "content": "### 2. Automatic Extensions\nIf You are unable to return to Singapore before the expiry date of the Period of Insurance as stated in the Policy Schedule, due to:\na. Your confinement in an overseas Hospital and/or quarantined under the written advice of a Registered Medical Practitioner due to Bodily Injury or Sickness arising from a cause covered under this Policy; or\nb. the scheduled Common Carrier in which You are travelling is delayed due to reasons beyond Your control.\nYour Policy will be automatically extended by fourteen (14) days from the expiry date without additional premium.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define the conditions under which the automatic extension of coverage applies when the insured is confined in an overseas hospital or quarantined, and what documentation is required to prove such confinement or quarantine?",
    "In what scenarios related to Common Carrier delays does the policy automatically extend coverage, and how is 'reasons beyond Your control' determined or evidenced?",
    "What is the maximum duration of the automatic extension granted if the insured cannot return to Singapore due to hospital confinement or quarantine, and does this extension apply if the confinement is due to a condition not covered under the policy?",
    "How does the automatic extension interact with the original Period of Insurance expiry date, and does the extension require any additional premium payment or notification to the insurer?",
    "If the insured is quarantined overseas under the advice of a Registered Medical Practitioner for a sickness not arising from a cause covered under the policy, is the automatic extension still granted?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the scheduled Common Carrier is delayed due to reasons within the insured's control, and does the automatic extension apply in such cases?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where both hospital confinement and Common Carrier delay occur simultaneously in terms of automatic extension duration and coverage?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations specified in the policy that override or limit the automatic extension provision, especially in cases related to pandemics or travel advisories?",
    "What documentation or proof must the insured provide to demonstrate that the scheduled Common Carrier delay was beyond their control to qualify for the automatic extension?",
    "Does the automatic extension provision apply if the insured is delayed due to quarantine imposed by authorities without a Registered Medical Practitioner's written advice?",
    "How does the policy treat automatic extensions if the insured's confinement or quarantine begins before the Period of Insurance expiry date but continues beyond it?",
    "Is the automatic extension of fourteen days a fixed period regardless of the length of the hospital confinement or Common Carrier delay, and can it be extended further under any circumstances?",
    "How does the policy define 'Common Carrier' in the context of automatic extensions, and are private or chartered transport services included or excluded?",
    "If the insured's return is delayed due to multiple causes, such as hospital confinement followed by Common Carrier delay, does the policy provide cumulative extensions or a single fourteen-day extension?",
    "What are the policy implications if the insured fails to notify the insurer about the delay or confinement before the original Period of Insurance expiry date?",
    "Does the automatic extension provision affect other sections of the policy, such as coverage limits or benefits, during the extended period?",
    "How does the policy address automatic extensions in cases where the insured is quarantined due to exposure to a contagious disease but is asymptomatic and not confined in a hospital?",
    "Are there any age or eligibility restrictions for the automatic extension provision, particularly for insured persons above a certain age or with pre-existing conditions?",
    "In the event of a Common Carrier delay caused by a publicly known event or travel alert, does the automatic extension still apply, or is it excluded under general policy exclusions?",
    "How does the automatic extension provision coordinate with other policy clauses related to trip duration limits, and does it affect the definition of a single Trip under the policy?"
