    "How does Section 40's exclusion of losses related to COVID-19 diagnoses at the time of application interact with any optional COVID-19 coverage extensions or riders that may be available in the policy?",
    "In cases where airport taxes and administration fees are non-refundable but included in flight costs, how does Section 40's exclusion impact the insured's ability to claim for these amounts after trip cancellation?",
