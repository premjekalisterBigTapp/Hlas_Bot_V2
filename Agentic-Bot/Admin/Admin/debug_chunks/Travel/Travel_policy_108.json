    "If a booked holiday is disrupted due to a government-imposed quarantine, how does Section 22 address claims, considering the exclusion of government regulations but the exception for compulsory quarantine?",
    "How does the exclusion of losses caused by amendments or delays in the booked itinerary by service providers affect claims for trip cancellation or curtailment under Section 22?",

    "If a booked holiday is affected by a government regulation that delays the itinerary but the insured is also financially unable to proceed, how do the combined exclusions in Section 22 influence claim outcomes?",
    "How does the exclusion of unlawful acts by the insured or related persons affect claims when the insured is not directly involved but the holiday plan depends on such a person?",
    "In what scenarios would compulsory quarantine be considered a valid reason for claim under Section 22 despite the general exclusion of government regulations?",
    "How does the policy address claims under Section 22 when the booked holiday provider's failure is due to an error or omission, and how does this exclusion differ from general service disruptions?",
