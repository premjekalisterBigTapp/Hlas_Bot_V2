  "questions": [
    "What is the maximum amount payable for physiotherapy treatment per Trip, and how does this limit interact with other medical expenses covered under Section 2?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for cosmetic or plastic surgery under Section 2, and are there any exceptions if such surgery is medically necessary due to an accident during the Trip?",
    "In what scenarios would the policy exclude payment for additional costs incurred from choosing a single or private room accommodation at a Hospital under Section 2?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between dental care covered under Section 2 and dental treatments that are excluded, particularly in cases of accidental injuries to sound natural teeth during the Trip?",
    "Are elective treatments such as aromatherapy, tonic medication, or services from health spas and massage parlours covered under Section 2, and what documentation is required to prove the nature of the treatment?",
    "How does the exclusion of services provided by convalescent or nursing homes or rehabilitation centres under Section 2 affect claims for post-accident recovery care during a Trip?",
    "What are the implications of excluding the cost of prosthetic devices or visual or hearing aids under Section 2 for a traveler who sustains an injury requiring such devices during the Trip?",
    "If a traveler incurs physiotherapy costs exceeding $500 during a Trip, how will the policy handle the excess amount, and are there any conditions under which the limit might be extended?",
    "How does the policy address claims for dental care necessitated by accidental injuries to sound natural teeth occurring during the Trip, and what proof is required to establish the accident and the condition of the teeth?",
    "In cases where a traveler requires both physiotherapy and elective treatments such as massage therapy during the Trip, how does the policy distinguish between covered and excluded expenses under Section 2?",
    "If a traveler opts for a private hospital room after an accident, how does the exclusion of additional single or private room accommodation costs affect the overall claim under Section 2?",
    "Are there any general exclusions or policy-wide conditions that override the Section 2 exclusions for cosmetic surgery or dental care, particularly in emergency situations?",

    "In the event that a traveler receives treatment at a rehabilitation centre following an accident during the Trip, how does the exclusion of such services under Section 2 impact the claim, and are there any exceptions?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for prosthetic devices or visual or hearing aids if these are required due to an accident occurring during the Trip, given the Section 2 exclusions?",
    "If a traveler receives physiotherapy treatment that is part of a rehabilitation program at a nursing home, how do the exclusions for nursing home services and the physiotherapy benefit interact under Section 2?",
    "Are there any conditions under which the policy would cover elective treatments or spa services if they are prescribed as part of a medically necessary recovery plan during the Trip?",
    "How do the Section 2 exclusions for cosmetic surgery and elective treatments affect claims arising from injuries sustained in a public accident versus pre-existing conditions exacerbated during the Trip?",
