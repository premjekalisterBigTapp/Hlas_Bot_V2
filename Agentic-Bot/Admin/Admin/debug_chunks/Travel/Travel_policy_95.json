  "questions": [
    "How does the requirement to notify the travel agent, tour operator, or provider immediately after deciding to cancel or curtail affect the eligibility for claims, and what are the implications if this notification is delayed?",
    "What are the consequences on coverage if the travel insurance policy is purchased less than three days before the scheduled trip commencement, and how does this limitation interact with urgent or last-minute travel plans?",
    "In what ways does the policy exclude losses that are already covered by other insurance schemes, government programs, or refunds from hotels, Common Carriers, travel agents, or accommodation providers, and how should a claimant coordinate benefits to avoid duplication?",
    "How does the exclusion of epidemics or pandemics declared by the World Health Organisation or the Ministry of Health of Singapore affect claims related to trip cancellation, postponement, or curtailment, especially in the context of COVID-19 or similar public health emergencies?",
    "What is the impact on claim eligibility when air miles, holiday points, membership rewards, or credit card redemptions are used to pay for all or part of the trip, and how does this exclusion apply if only a portion of the trip cost is covered by such means?",
    "If a traveler cancels a trip due to a covered event but fails to notify the travel provider immediately, how does this failure interact with other policy exclusions such as those related to pandemics or late policy purchase?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where a trip is cancelled due to a pandemic declared after the policy purchase, considering the exclusion of epidemics and pandemics and the timing of the policy purchase relative to the trip start date?",
    "In cases where a traveler uses a combination of payment methods including cash and air miles for the trip, how does the exclusion of air miles or points affect the reimbursable amount under the policy?",
    "What documentation or proof is required to demonstrate that a loss is not covered by other insurance schemes or government programs, and how does this affect the processing of claims under this policy?",
    "How does the policy define the timing and method of notification to the travel agent or provider to satisfy the immediate notification requirement, and what are the consequences of failing to meet this standard?",
    "If a traveler purchases the policy exactly three days before the trip, is coverage fully effective, and how does the policy treat borderline timing cases for policy purchase relative to trip commencement?",
    "How does the exclusion of losses covered by refunds from travel providers interact with claims for additional expenses incurred due to trip curtailment or delays?",
    "In the event of a pandemic declared mid-trip, how does the exclusion apply to claims for trip curtailment or additional costs, and are there any exceptions or extensions provided by the policy?",
    "What are the implications of the exclusion related to the use of credit card redemptions on the overall claim amount, especially when the credit card issuer provides travel insurance benefits as well?",
    "How does the policy address scenarios where a traveler fails to notify the provider immediately but can prove that the delay did not cause additional loss or prejudice to the insurer?",
    "What is the interplay between the exclusion for late policy purchase and the exclusion for epidemics or pandemics, particularly if the policy is bought shortly before a declared health emergency?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for losses arising from travel arrangements partially paid with holiday points when the rest is paid in cash, and what portion of the loss is excluded?",
    "In cases where a traveler receives a refund from a Common Carrier for a cancelled flight, how does this affect the claim under this policy, and what documentation is necessary to substantiate the refund?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between losses covered by government programs and those covered by private insurance, and what is the claimant's responsibility to disclose such coverage?",
    "What are the policy implications if a traveler cancels due to a reason related to a pandemic but the pandemic is not officially declared by the WHO or Ministry of Health at the time of cancellation?"
