  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define the documentation requirements and timing for claims related to flight diversion delays and hijack incidents on a Common Carrier, and what specific details must the written verification include?",
    "In the event of a flight diversion causing delay, how is the $100 payment structured in relation to continuous six-hour periods, and what is the maximum benefit limit applicable under this policy?",
    "What conditions must be met for the policy to pay benefits for a hijack of a Common Carrier, and how does the confinement during the hijack affect eligibility for the $100 per six-hour period payment?",
    "How does the policy handle claims arising from the same event under Sections 21, 23, 26, 27, or 44, and what restrictions exist regarding claiming benefits from multiple sections for a single incident?",
    "What is the role of the Common Carrier operator or handling agent in verifying claims for flight diversion or hijack, and how might failure to provide their written verification impact claim approval?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between delays caused by flight diversion and those caused by hijack in terms of benefit payments and claim documentation?",
    "In scenarios where a flight diversion causes a delay but the insured reaches the destination via a different Common Carrier, how does the policy determine the start and end times for calculating the six-hour benefit periods?",
    "What are the implications of the policy’s limitation that only one section (among 21, 23, 26, 27, or 44) can be claimed for the same event, especially if the event involves both a flight diversion and a hijack?",
    "How does the policy define a Common Carrier for the purposes of Sections 27 and related delay benefits, and what types of transportation would qualify or be excluded?",
    "If the insured experiences a flight diversion followed by a hijack on the same trip, how does the policy apply the benefit limits and payment calculations for each event?",
    "What are the potential exclusions or general policy conditions that might override or limit the payment of $100 per six-hour period for flight diversion or hijack delays?",
    "How does the policy address situations where the written verification from the Common Carrier operator is delayed or unavailable, and what alternative evidence might be acceptable for claim processing?",
    "In the event of a hijack, how does the policy determine the continuous six-hour periods for payment if the confinement duration is irregular or interrupted?",
    "How does the policy’s benefit limit cap interact with multiple continuous six-hour periods of delay due to flight diversion or hijack, and what happens if the delay exceeds the maximum benefit limit?",
    "What are the procedural steps and timing requirements for submitting a claim under Section 27 for hijack, and how do these compare to those for flight diversion delays under the related section?",
    "How does the policy ensure that claims for flight diversion or hijack delays are not duplicated under other sections, and what mechanisms are in place to prevent overlapping claims for the same event?",
    "In cases where the scheduled and actual arrival and departure times differ significantly due to a flight diversion, how does the policy calculate the eligible delay periods for benefit payments?",
    "How might the policy’s exclusions related to terrorism, war, or unlawful acts affect claims under Section 27 for hijack of a Common Carrier?",
    "What is the significance of the policy’s note that only one section can be claimed for the same event, and how should insured persons decide which section to claim under when multiple sections could apply?",
    "How does the policy define the start and end points of a 'Trip' in relation to delays caused by flight diversion or hijack, and how does this affect the calculation of continuous six-hour periods for benefit payments?"
