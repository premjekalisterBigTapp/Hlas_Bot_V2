  "questions": [
    "How does the policy treat claims arising from unlawful acts or criminal proceedings involving the insured or related persons, and what exceptions apply for witness summons, jury service, or compulsory quarantine?",
    "In what ways do pre-existing medical conditions, compulsory quarantine, strikes, riots, military power, hijack, adverse weather, or travel alerts existing at the time of application affect claim eligibility under this policy?",
    "What are the consequences of failing to notify the travel agent, tour operator, or transport/accommodation provider immediately after deciding to cancel or curtail travel arrangements, and how does this impact claim approval?",
    "How does purchasing the policy less than three days before the scheduled trip commencement limit coverage for certain events, and which covered events are specifically excluded under this condition?",
    "When a travel alert exists at the time of insurance application, how does this general exclusion interact with any section-specific coverage for trip cancellation or curtailment due to such alerts?",
    "If a compulsory quarantine is imposed after policy purchase but was not existing at the time of application, how does the policy address coverage compared to quarantine existing at application time?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between civil commotion and an uprising in terms of exclusions, and what impact does this have on claims related to riots or civil unrest?",
    "In cases where the insured is summoned for jury service or witness summons, how does the policy treat claims arising from trip cancellation or curtailment due to these legal obligations?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to demonstrate immediate notification to travel agents or providers after deciding to cancel or curtail travel, and how does timing affect claim validity?",
    "How do exclusions related to unlawful acts or criminal proceedings apply if the insured is indirectly involved or dependent on a person committing such acts, and what are the limits of this dependency?",
    "If adverse weather conditions exist at the time of application but worsen significantly during the trip, how does the policy handle claims related to weather disruptions?",
    "How does the policy address claims if the insured purchases coverage exactly three days before the trip, and does this timing affect all covered events or only specific ones?",
    "In the event of a strike or industrial action existing at application time, how does this exclusion interact with any subsequent strikes occurring during the trip?",
    "What is the policy's stance on claims arising from hijack situations, and how does this exclusion relate to other covered peril exclusions such as military or usurped power?",
    "How does the policy define the timing for 'immediate' notification to travel providers after deciding to cancel or curtail, and what are the implications for claims if this timing is not met?",
    "If a travel alert is publicly announced after policy purchase but before trip commencement, how does the exclusion for travel alerts existing at application time apply or not apply?",
    "How do the exclusions for unlawful acts and criminal proceedings interact with compulsory quarantine exclusions, especially if quarantine results from such acts?",
    "What are the implications for claims if the insured or a dependent person is involved in criminal proceedings but the trip is curtailed due to unrelated health issues?",
    "How does the policy treat claims if the insured fails to notify the travel provider immediately but provides notification within a reasonable but not immediate timeframe?",
    "In what scenarios would the exclusion for military or usurped power apply, and how does this exclusion affect coverage for trip interruptions caused by government or military actions?"
