The use for any air miles, holiday points, membership or credit card redemption You use to pay for all or part of Your Trip.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy handle coverage for events occurring if the insurance is purchased less than three days before the scheduled trip, and what implications does this have for last-minute travelers?",
    "In what ways does the policy exclude losses that are covered by other insurance schemes, government programs, or refunds from hotels, Common Carriers, travel agents, or other travel providers, and how should a claimant document such overlapping coverage?",
    "How does the exclusion of epidemics or pandemics declared by the World Health Organisation or the Ministry of Health of Singapore affect claims related to trip cancellations or interruptions due to such health crises?",
    "What are the conditions and limitations regarding the use of air miles, holiday points, membership, or credit card redemptions in paying for trips, and how does this exclusion impact the calculation of claimable amounts?",
    "If a traveler purchases the policy two days before their trip and experiences a covered event, how does the policy's timing restriction affect their eligibility for claims, especially in relation to other general exclusions?",
    "When a loss is partially covered by a government program and partially by this policy, how does the policy coordinate benefits and what documentation is required to prove the extent of coverage from other sources?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between losses caused by epidemics or pandemics declared by different authorities, and what is the precedence if such declarations differ between the WHO and Singapore's Ministry of Health?",
    "If a traveler uses a combination of cash and air miles to pay for their trip, how does the exclusion of air miles usage affect the reimbursable amount under the policy, and what proof is needed to substantiate the payment method?",
    "In cases where a hotel or Common Carrier refunds a portion of the trip cost after a loss, how does this refund interact with the policy's exclusion of losses covered by other providers, and what timing or documentation is required to claim the balance?",
    "How does the policy address claims arising from pandemics that were declared after the policy purchase but before the trip commencement, considering the exclusion clause related to epidemics and pandemics?",
    "What are the implications of the exclusion of losses covered by other insurance or government schemes on claims involving pre-existing conditions or optional covers that might overlap with such schemes?",
    "If a traveler redeems credit card points for part of their trip payment and then files a claim, how does the policy's exclusion of such redemption affect the claim amount and what evidence must be provided?",
    "How does the policy's exclusion of losses covered by other providers apply when a travel agent offers a partial refund due to service failure, and how should the insured coordinate claims between the agent and the insurer?",
    "In the event of a pandemic declared by the WHO but not by the Ministry of Health of Singapore, how does the policy apply the epidemic/pandemic exclusion, and which declaration takes precedence for claim denial?",
    "When a trip is paid entirely with holiday points, how does the policy's exclusion of such payment methods affect the availability of coverage for trip cancellation or interruption claims?",
    "If a traveler experiences a loss covered by both this policy and a government program, what steps must be taken to avoid double compensation, and how does the policy enforce this exclusion?",
    "How does the policy define a Common Carrier in relation to the exclusion of losses covered by providers, and what documentation is necessary to prove coverage or refunds from such carriers?",
    "What are the consequences for claims if the insured fails to disclose the use of air miles or credit card redemptions in trip payment, given the policy's exclusion of such payment methods?",
    "How does the exclusion of epidemics or pandemics interact with other general exclusions, such as publicly known events or travel advisories, when determining claim eligibility?",
    "In scenarios where a hotel or travel agent refuses to refund after a covered loss, how does the policy's exclusion of losses covered by other providers affect the insured's ability to claim under this policy?"
