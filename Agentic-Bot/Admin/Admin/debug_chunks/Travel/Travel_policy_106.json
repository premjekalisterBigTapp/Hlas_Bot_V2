  "content": "* (e) cancellation of the scheduled Common Carrier services in which You have arranged to travel on to commence the Trip for at least twenty-four (24) hours from the time specified in the travel itinerary, due to strike or other industrial action, riot or civil commotion not assuming the proportions of or amounting to an uprising, military or usurped power;\n* (f) cancellation of Your Flight which You have arranged to travel, due to closure of the airport, runway or airspace or adverse weather conditions which forces Your Flight to be grounded; or\n* (g) the issuance of Travel Alert for the planned destination.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define coverage for cancellation due to industrial action or riot, and what specific conditions must be met regarding the timing of the Common Carrier service and the nature of the civil commotion?",
    "In what ways does the policy address cancellation of flights caused by airport or airspace closure, and how are adverse weather conditions factored into the eligibility for claims under this scenario?",
    "What are the requirements and limitations for claiming trip cancellation benefits when a Travel Alert is issued for the planned destination, and how might this interact with other general exclusions in the policy?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between different types of civil disturbances such as riots versus uprisings or military power, and what impact does this distinction have on coverage for trip cancellation?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to substantiate a claim for cancellation due to strike or industrial action affecting the Common Carrier service, especially considering the 24-hour minimum delay condition?",
    "How does the policy handle cancellations when multiple causes occur simultaneously, for example, a flight cancellation due to both adverse weather and a Travel Alert issued for the destination?",
    "Are cancellations due to strikes or industrial actions covered if the disruption affects the Common Carrier service less than 24 hours from the scheduled departure time, and how does this timing affect claim eligibility?",
    "What exclusions or limitations might apply if the cancellation is due to a civil commotion that escalates to an uprising or military takeover, given the policy's wording?",
    "How does the policy define a 'Common Carrier' in relation to cancellations caused by industrial action or riot, and does this definition affect the types of transport covered under these clauses?",
    "In the event of a flight cancellation due to adverse weather, what conditions must be met for the policy to consider the flight as 'grounded,' and how does this influence claim approval?",
    "How does the issuance timing of a Travel Alert relative to the trip commencement affect the coverage for trip cancellation under this policy section?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a flight is cancelled due to airport closure caused by reasons other than those explicitly mentioned, such as technical failures or security threats?",
    "How does the policy address cancellations caused by industrial action or strikes that are planned or publicly known before the trip was booked, especially in relation to general exclusions?",
    "What is the interplay between the policy’s coverage for cancellation due to adverse weather and any general exclusions related to natural disasters or force majeure events?",
    "How might the policy treat cancellations due to civil commotion that is localized and short-lived versus widespread and prolonged, in terms of coverage eligibility?",
    "What evidence is required to prove that a flight cancellation was directly caused by runway or airspace closure, and how does this affect the claim process?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where a Travel Alert is issued after the trip has commenced, and does this affect the possibility of claiming cancellation benefits?",
    "Are cancellations due to industrial action covered if the strike occurs at a connecting Common Carrier service rather than the initial carrier arranged for the trip commencement?",
    "How does the policy define the term 'Flight' in the context of cancellations due to adverse weather or airport closure, and does this include chartered or private flights?",
    "What are the policy’s provisions regarding cancellation claims when multiple flights are booked as part of a single trip and only one flight is cancelled due to the specified causes?"
