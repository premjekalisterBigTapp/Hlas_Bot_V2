  "questions": [
    "How does the policy handle coverage for additional costs of single or private hospital room accommodation when it is not medically directed to contain COVID-19 spread, and how does this exclusion interact with general medical expense benefits?",
    "In what scenarios are elective treatments, including aromatherapy, tonic medication, and services from health spas or rehabilitation centers, excluded from coverage, and how does this affect claims for post-illness recovery care?",
    "Are costs related to prosthetic devices or visual and hearing aids covered under this policy, and how do these exclusions impact claims for long-term disability or injury sustained during the trip?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a traveler tests positive on a mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 diagnostic test before the trip, particularly regarding trip cancellation or interruption benefits?",
    "How does the policy define 'Fully Vaccinated' in relation to COVID-19, and what are the consequences for coverage if the insured is not fully vaccinated at the time of travel?",
    "Can a claim for additional hospital accommodation costs be approved if the single or private room is requested for personal comfort rather than medical necessity related to COVID-19 containment?",
    "How do exclusions for elective treatments and services from nursing or convalescent homes affect coverage for rehabilitation following an accident during the trip?",
    "If a traveler requires prosthetic devices or hearing aids due to an injury sustained during the trip, how does the exclusion of these costs affect the overall medical expense reimbursement?",
    "What documentation or proof is required to demonstrate that a positive pre-departure COVID-19 test led to trip cancellation, and how does this exclusion affect the insured's ability to claim trip cancellation benefits?",
    "In cases where the insured is partially vaccinated or has received vaccines not recognized by the policy, how is coverage affected under the 'not Fully Vaccinated' exclusion?",
    "Does the exclusion of costs for aromatherapy and tonic medication apply if these treatments are prescribed by a Registered Medical Practitioner as part of post-COVID recovery?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for hospital accommodation upgrades requested by the insured for privacy reasons unrelated to COVID-19 infection control?",
    "Are rehabilitation center services excluded regardless of whether they are part of a medically necessary recovery plan following an injury or illness during the trip?",
    "If a traveler tests positive for COVID-19 after departure but had a negative mandatory pre-departure test, how does the exclusion for positive pre-departure tests affect coverage for medical expenses or trip interruption?",
    "How does the policy address claims for visual aids if the insured's need for such devices arises from an accident during the trip versus a pre-existing condition?",
    "What are the consequences for coverage if the insured fails to meet the vaccination requirements due to medical exemptions, considering the 'not Fully Vaccinated' exclusion?",
    "How do the exclusions for elective treatments and health spa services interact with coverage for mental health or stress-related treatments during the trip?",
    "In the event of a positive pre-departure COVID-19 test, are there any exceptions or partial coverages available for non-medical trip expenses incurred?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between medically necessary prosthetic devices and cosmetic or elective prosthetics in terms of coverage exclusions?",
