  "questions": [
    "How does the policy handle extra expenses incurred to extend a trip beyond the original schedule when the extension is medically necessary and supported by a Registered Medical Practitioner's written request, compared to extensions for other reasons?",
    "In what scenarios would losses be excluded due to coverage by other existing insurance schemes, government programs, or refunds from hotels, Common Carriers, travel agents, or other travel/accommodation providers, and how should a claimant document these overlaps?",
    "How does the policy treat claims involving trip costs partially or fully paid using air miles, holiday points, membership rewards, or credit card redemptions, and what impact does this have on claim eligibility or reimbursement amounts?",
    "If a trip extension is requested verbally by a Registered Medical Practitioner but not documented in writing, how does this affect coverage for extra expenses under the policy?",
    "When a loss is covered both by this policy and a government program, how does the policy determine which coverage applies first, and what are the claimant's obligations to avoid double compensation?",
    "How are refunds or payments from Common Carriers or travel agents factored into claims for trip interruption or cancellation, especially when the claimant has also purchased this insurance?",
    "What documentation is required to prove that a loss is not covered by any other insurance scheme or government program to qualify for a claim under this policy?",
    "How does the policy define a Common Carrier in relation to exclusions for losses covered by other providers, and does this affect claims for delays or cancellations?",
    "If a traveler uses a combination of cash and holiday points to pay for a trip, how does the policy calculate the reimbursable amount in the event of a claim?",
    "Are there any exceptions to the exclusion of losses covered by other providers if the reimbursement from those providers is delayed or insufficient, and how should this be demonstrated?",
    "How does the policy address claims for extra expenses incurred due to trip extensions caused by non-medical emergencies, and what documentation would be necessary to contest such exclusions?",
    "In cases where a hotel or travel agent offers a refund after a claim has been submitted, how must the insured notify the insurer, and what are the implications for claim settlement?",
    "Does the policy exclude losses related to the redemption of credit card points if the points are later revoked or canceled, and how does this affect claim validity?",
    "How are claims handled if a traveler extends their trip due to quarantine requirements but lacks a Registered Medical Practitioner's written recommendation?",
    "What is the interaction between the exclusion of losses covered by other insurance or government programs and any general policy-wide exclusions related to pre-existing conditions or pandemics?",
    "If a traveler redeems membership points for part of the trip cost and then cancels the trip, how does the policy treat refunds or reimbursements related to those points in the claim process?",
    "How does the policy verify that a loss is not recoverable from any other provider, and what steps must the insured take if multiple providers are involved in the trip arrangements?",
    "Are there any provisions for partial reimbursement if only a portion of the trip cost was paid using air miles or holiday points, and how is this calculated?",
    "How does the policy address claims for extra expenses when the extension is medically necessary but the Registered Medical Practitioner is not locally licensed or recognized by the insurer?",
    "In the event of a claim involving trip extension expenses, how does the insurer coordinate with other providers or insurers to avoid duplication of benefits, and what documentation supports this process?"
