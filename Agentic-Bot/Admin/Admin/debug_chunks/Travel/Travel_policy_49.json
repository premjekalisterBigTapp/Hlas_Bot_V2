  "content": "**\"Curtailment\"** means abandonment by You of a Trip by returning to Singapore after arrival at the booked destination before the scheduled return date set out in the Policy Schedule.\n\n**\"Diagnosed\"** means the diagnosis of Your medical condition from medical testing laboratories that are either recognized by the respective governments Competent Authorities or accredited in the area of molecular microbiology or immunology, excluding any self-testing.\n\n**\"Extreme Sports\"** means any sports or activities that present a high level of inherent danger (i.e. involve exceptional speed, height, physical exertion, high level of expertise or highly specialized gear or stunts).",
  "questions": [
    "How does the definition of 'Curtailment' affect the eligibility for claims if You return to Singapore early due to a medical emergency, and what documentation is required to prove the early return date compared to the scheduled return date in the Policy Schedule?",
    "In what scenarios would a diagnosis be considered valid under the policy, considering the requirement for medical testing laboratories to be recognized by government Competent Authorities or accredited in molecular microbiology or immunology, and how does this exclusion of self-testing impact claims related to infectious diseases?",
    "How might the policy treat claims arising from injuries sustained while participating in 'Extreme Sports', given the definition involving exceptional speed, height, physical exertion, expertise, or specialized gear, and are there any general or section-specific exclusions that override coverage for such activities?",
    "If You abandon a Trip by returning to Singapore before the scheduled return date due to a non-medical reason, how does the definition of 'Curtailment' influence claim acceptance, and what proof is needed to establish the timing of return relative to the Policy Schedule?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between a valid medical diagnosis and self-testing results when submitting claims for infectious or immunological conditions, and what impact does this have on the timing and acceptance of claims?",
    "Considering the definition of 'Extreme Sports', how does the policy address coverage for injuries sustained during activities that may not be explicitly listed but meet the criteria of high danger and specialized gear, and what documentation is required to verify the nature of the sport?",
    "In the event of a claim for trip curtailment due to a diagnosed medical condition, how does the policy verify that the diagnosis meets the definition provided, and what role do accredited laboratories play in validating the claim?",
    "How does the policy handle claims if the diagnosis is made by a laboratory not recognized by the respective government Competent Authorities or lacking accreditation in molecular microbiology or immunology, especially in the context of infectious diseases or pandemics?",
    "What are the implications of the 'Curtailment' definition on claims if You return early due to quarantine requirements or travel restrictions, and how does this interact with other policy provisions or exclusions?",
    "How does the exclusion of self-testing from the definition of 'Diagnosed' affect claims related to COVID-19 or other conditions where rapid home tests are common, and what alternative proof is required to satisfy the diagnosis criteria?",
    "If You engage in an activity classified as an 'Extreme Sport' and suffer an injury, how does the policy determine whether the activity's inherent danger level excludes coverage, and are there any exceptions or optional covers that might apply?",
    "How does the policy define the scheduled return date in the Policy Schedule for the purpose of determining 'Curtailment', and what happens if the return date is changed after the policy is issued?",
    "In cases where a diagnosis is made based on molecular microbiology or immunology tests from multiple laboratories, some recognized and some not, how does the policy assess the validity of the diagnosis for claim purposes?",
    "How does the policy address claims for injuries or illnesses resulting from participation in sports that border between regular and 'Extreme Sports', and what criteria are used to classify the activity under the policy definitions?",
    "What documentation or evidence is required to prove that a Trip was curtailed as defined, especially in cases where the early return is voluntary or due to external factors like natural disasters or political unrest?",
    "How does the policy's definition of 'Diagnosed' impact the timing of claims submission, particularly when waiting for laboratory confirmation from accredited sources might delay diagnosis beyond typical claim windows?",
    "Are there any general exclusions that override coverage for claims related to 'Extreme Sports' despite the definition provided, and how do these exclusions interact with optional covers or endorsements?",
    "How does the policy treat situations where the scheduled return date is ambiguous or not clearly stated in the Policy Schedule, in relation to the definition of 'Curtailment' and claim eligibility?",
    "In the context of infectious disease claims, how does the policy ensure that diagnoses meet the accreditation and recognition standards, and what are the consequences if the diagnosis is based on unaccredited or foreign laboratories?",
    "How does the policy define and verify the level of expertise or specialized gear involved in an activity to classify it as an 'Extreme Sport', and how does this classification affect the scope of coverage or exclusions?"
