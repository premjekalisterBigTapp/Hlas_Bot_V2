  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define coverage for flight cancellations caused by airport, runway, or airspace closures compared to cancellations due to adverse weather conditions, and what documentation is required to support such claims?",
    "In what ways does the issuance of a Travel Alert for the planned destination affect the eligibility for trip cancellation benefits, and are there any exceptions or exclusions related to Travel Alerts in the general policy exclusions?",
    "If a flight is cancelled due to adverse weather conditions but the airline offers an alternative flight on a different day, how does the policy address claims for cancellation or postponement under these circumstances?",
    "How do the conditions for flight cancellation coverage due to airport or airspace closure interact with other policy sections that exclude coverage for publicly known events or government advisories?",
    "What are the timeframes and notification requirements for reporting a flight cancellation caused by adverse weather or airport closure to qualify for claim reimbursement under this policy?",
    "Does the policy provide coverage for additional expenses incurred due to flight cancellation from airport closure or adverse weather, such as accommodation or meals, and what limits or conditions apply?",
    "How does the policy treat claims if a Travel Alert is issued after the insured has already commenced their trip, and does this affect coverage for trip curtailment or interruption?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations if the flight cancellation is due to a Travel Alert issued for reasons related to pandemics or health emergencies, and how do these interact with general policy exclusions?",
    "In the event of a flight cancellation due to runway closure, what proof must the insured provide to demonstrate that the cancellation was not voluntary or due to their own actions?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between cancellations caused by adverse weather conditions and those caused by mechanical failure or airline operational issues, and are both covered under the same clause?",
    "If a Travel Alert is issued for a destination but the insured chooses to proceed with travel, how does this decision impact coverage for subsequent claims related to trip interruption or cancellation?",
    "What is the policy's stance on coverage if the insured's flight is cancelled due to a Travel Alert that was publicly announced well before the trip was booked, considering the timing of the alert issuance?",
    "How do the coverage provisions for flight cancellation due to airport or airspace closure apply when the insured is traveling on a chartered flight versus a commercial airline?",
    "Are claims for flight cancellation due to adverse weather conditions subject to any deductibles or co-payments, and how does this compare to cancellations due to Travel Alerts?",
    "In cases where a flight cancellation is caused by multiple factors, such as both adverse weather and a Travel Alert, how does the policy determine which clause applies and how benefits are calculated?",
    "Does the policy require the insured to attempt rebooking or alternative travel arrangements after a flight cancellation due to airport closure or adverse weather before a claim can be made?",
    "How does the policy address coverage for flight cancellations when the Travel Alert is issued by a foreign government or international organization rather than the insured's home country authorities?",
    "What exclusions in the general policy might override coverage for flight cancellations caused by Travel Alerts or airport closures, such as exclusions for known events or failure to comply with travel advisories?",
    "If a flight cancellation due to adverse weather results in a delay rather than a full cancellation, does the policy provide any benefits or extensions, and what conditions apply?",
    "How are claims handled if the insured cancels their flight voluntarily after a Travel Alert is issued, and what documentation is needed to prove the cancellation was directly related to the alert?"
