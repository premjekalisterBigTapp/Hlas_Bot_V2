  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define coverage for flight cancellations caused by airport, runway, or airspace closures compared to cancellations due to adverse weather conditions, and what documentation is required to support such claims?",
    "In what ways does the issuance of a Travel Alert for the planned destination affect the eligibility for trip cancellation benefits, and are there any exceptions or exclusions related to Travel Alerts?",
    "If a flight is cancelled due to adverse weather conditions but the airport remains open, how does the policy determine coverage, and what proof must the insured provide to substantiate the claim?",
    "How do coverage provisions for flight cancellations caused by airport or airspace closures interact with general policy exclusions such as publicly known events or pre-existing conditions?",
    "What is the impact of a Travel Alert issued after the insured has already commenced travel on the ability to claim for trip cancellation or interruption under this policy?",
    "Are cancellations due to partial airport closures or limited runway availability covered under the clause for airport or runway closure, and how is this assessed by the insurer?",
    "How does the policy address situations where a flight is grounded due to a combination of adverse weather and airspace closure, and what documentation is required to demonstrate the cause of cancellation?",
    "In cases where a Travel Alert is issued for a destination but the insured chooses to proceed with travel, how does this affect coverage for subsequent trip cancellation or curtailment claims?",
    "What are the timeframes within which a Travel Alert must be issued relative to the planned departure date for the cancellation coverage to apply?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between cancellations caused by government-mandated airport closures versus closures due to operational issues unrelated to weather or alerts?",
    "If a flight cancellation occurs due to adverse weather conditions but the airline offers an alternative flight, how does this affect the insured's right to claim under the cancellation coverage?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations if the insured fails to notify the insurer promptly after a flight cancellation caused by airport or airspace closure or adverse weather?",
    "How does the policy handle claims when a Travel Alert is issued for a destination regionally adjacent to the planned destination, and the insured cancels due to perceived risk?",
    "What evidence must the insured provide to prove that their flight was grounded specifically due to adverse weather conditions rather than other operational issues?",
    "Does the policy cover cancellations resulting from airport closures caused by security threats or strikes, or are these excluded under general or section-specific exclusions?",
    "How do the cancellation provisions for flight grounding due to adverse weather interact with any quarantine or COVID-19 related exclusions or conditions in the policy?",
    "If a Travel Alert is issued for a destination after the insured has already departed, can this be used as a valid reason for trip curtailment claims under the policy?",
    "Are there any age or pre-existing condition restrictions that affect coverage for flight cancellations due to airport closures, adverse weather, or Travel Alerts?",
    "How does the policy address situations where the insured cancels a flight due to a Travel Alert but the alert is later downgraded or lifted before the planned departure date?",
    "In the event of a flight cancellation due to adverse weather or airport closure, what role do carrier-issued documents or official notices play in substantiating a claim?"
