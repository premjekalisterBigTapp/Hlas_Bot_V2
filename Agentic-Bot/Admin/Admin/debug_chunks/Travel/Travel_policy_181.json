  "questions": [
    "How does the policy differentiate coverage for epidemics or pandemics declared by the WHO or Singapore's Ministry of Health, specifically excluding them except for COVID-19 under certain sections, and what implications does this have for claims related to other epidemics?",
    "In what scenarios would coverage be denied due to your engagement in naval, military, air force, civil defence, or police services, and how do exclusions apply if you are involved in testing conveyances or working in high-risk occupations like mining or handling explosives during your trip?",
    "How does the exclusion of Pre-Existing Medical Conditions interact with the optional covers under Sections 43a and 43b for Overseas Medical Expenses and Emergency Medical Evacuation, and what documentation or conditions must be met to claim under these exceptions?",
    "What are the limitations on coverage for mental, nervous, or sleep disorders, including diagnosed psychiatric conditions such as anxiety or depression, and how might this affect claims for treatment or evacuation related to these conditions during travel?",
    "How does the policy address claims arising from wilful, malicious, criminal, or unlawful acts committed by the insured or persons acting on their behalf, and what evidence is required to establish such exclusions?",
    "If a traveler contracts a disease during a pandemic not declared by WHO or Singapore’s Ministry of Health, how would the epidemic or pandemic exclusion apply, and are there any exceptions similar to the COVID-19 coverage sections?",
    "How are claims handled if the insured is employed as a manual worker or engaged in off-shore activities during the trip, considering the exclusion for such occupations, and does this affect coverage for accidents or medical emergencies?",
    "What is the impact of the exclusion for aerial photography and handling of firearms or ammunition on coverage for travelers participating in these activities, and are there any circumstances under which claims might still be considered?",
    "How do the exclusions for mental and nervous disorders affect coverage for emergency medical evacuation or overseas medical expenses if these conditions are linked to a pre-existing medical condition covered under Sections 43a or 43b?",
    "In cases where a claim involves both a pre-existing medical condition and a mental health disorder, how does the policy determine which exclusion or coverage applies, especially if the mental health condition is secondary to the pre-existing condition?",
    "What documentation or proof is required to demonstrate that a claim does not involve wilful or criminal acts by the insured or their representatives, and how does this affect the claims process?",
    "How does the policy treat claims related to COVID-19 differently from other epidemics or pandemics, and what specific sections provide coverage for COVID-19 that override the general epidemic exclusion?",
    "If a traveler is involved in police operations or civil defence activities during their trip, how does this exclusion affect their eligibility for claims under medical or accident sections of the policy?",
    "How does the exclusion for testing of any kind of conveyance apply to travelers who participate in vehicle testing or trials during their trip, and what are the implications for coverage of injuries or damages sustained?",
    "Are there any age or activity-based exceptions to the exclusion of manual workers or off-shore employment, and how does the policy define these roles in relation to coverage eligibility?",
    "How does the policy handle claims arising from mental or nervous disorders that manifest for the first time during travel, and are these treated differently from pre-existing psychiatric conditions?",
    "In the event of a claim involving explosives or ammunition handling, what specific exclusions apply, and how might this interact with general exclusions related to unlawful acts or high-risk activities?",
    "How does the policy address situations where a person acting on behalf of the insured commits a criminal or unlawful act leading to a claim, and what impact does this have on the insured’s coverage?",
    "What are the implications of the epidemic or pandemic exclusion on quarantine-related claims, especially if the quarantine is due to a disease other than COVID-19?",
    "How do the exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions and mental disorders interact with the policy’s general exclusions, and which takes precedence when both are relevant to a claim?"
