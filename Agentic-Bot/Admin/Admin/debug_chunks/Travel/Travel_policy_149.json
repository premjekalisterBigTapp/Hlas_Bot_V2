  "questions": [
    "How does the policy handle claims under Section 42 when the loss is also covered by another insurance scheme, government program, or refunded by a travel service provider, and what documentation is required to prove such coverage?",
    "In what scenarios would a claim under Section 42 be denied due to the insured's change of mind, fear of travelling, or disinclination to travel, and how does this exclusion interact with other covered reasons for cancellation?",
    "What are the consequences under Section 42 if the insured fails to notify the travel agent, tour operator, or transport/accommodation provider immediately upon deciding to cancel or curtail the trip, and how does this affect claim eligibility and timing requirements?",
    "How does a diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection for the insured, their travel companion, or immediate family member at the time of insurance application impact the validity of claims under Section 42, and are there any exceptions or documentation requirements related to this exclusion?",
    "Are airport taxes and administration fees included in flight costs covered under Section 42 claims, and how should insured persons handle these charges when submitting claims for trip cancellation or curtailment?",
    "What is the effect on Section 42 claims if the insured tests positive on a mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 diagnostic test before the trip, and how does this exclusion relate to other COVID-19 related exclusions in the policy?",
    "How do the exclusions related to COVID-19 (diagnosis at application and positive pre-departure test) under Section 42 interact with general policy exclusions and other sections that might cover COVID-19 related events?",
    "If a travel companion or immediate family member is diagnosed with COVID-19 after the insurance application but before departure, how does this affect Section 42 coverage, considering the exclusion only mentions diagnosis at the time of application?",
    "In cases where a hotel or Common Carrier refunds part of the trip cost due to cancellation, how does this refund affect the amount payable under Section 42, and what proof must the insured provide to avoid double compensation?",
    "How does the policy define 'immediate notification' to travel agents or providers for cancellation or curtailment under Section 42, and what evidence is required to demonstrate compliance with this condition?",
    "If a trip is cancelled due to fear of travelling caused by a public health alert or travel advisory, does the exclusion for disinclination or fear of travelling under Section 42 apply, or are there exceptions for such externally imposed reasons?",
    "How are airport taxes and administration fees treated in claims involving partial trip cancellations or curtailments under Section 42, especially when these fees are non-refundable?",
    "What documentation is required to prove that a loss is not covered by any other insurance or government program as per Section 42 exclusions, and how does this affect the claims process?",
    "If the insured fails a mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 test but the test is later found to be a false positive, how does the exclusion under Section 42 for positive pre-departure tests apply, and can the insured appeal the claim denial?",
    "How does the exclusion for loss covered by other providers under Section 42 apply when multiple travel service providers are involved, such as a travel agent and a hotel, and how should claims be coordinated?",
    "In what ways do the Section 42 exclusions for COVID-19 diagnosis at application and positive pre-departure tests affect coverage for trips postponed due to quarantine requirements imposed after policy purchase?",
    "If the insured cancels a trip due to a travel companion testing positive for COVID-19 after the insurance application but before departure, is this covered under Section 42, given the exclusions specified?",
    "How does the policy address claims under Section 42 when the insured cancels due to administrative fees or airport taxes that are non-refundable, and are these fees ever reimbursable under any circumstances?",
    "What is the interplay between the exclusion for failure to notify providers immediately and the timing of claims submission under Section 42, and can late notification be excused under any conditions?",
    "How does the exclusion for disinclination or fear of travelling under Section 42 apply to insured persons who cancel due to anxiety or mental health conditions, and are such reasons ever covered under other sections or optional covers?"
