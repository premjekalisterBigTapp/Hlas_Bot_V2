  "content": "Q: What does the Flight Delay add-on cover?\nA: This add-on enhances your travel inconvenience coverage by reducing the minimum flight delay time required for compensation. With this benefit: Claim eligibility begins after just 3 hours of flight delay, rather than the standard 6-hour waiting period. You may receive $100 compensation for every 3-hour period of delay, starting from the 3-hour mark. This add-on is especially valuable for travellers with connecting flights or time-sensitive itineraries.",
