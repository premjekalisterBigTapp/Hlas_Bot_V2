  "questions": [
    "How do the per day limits vary across the Enhanced, Superior, and Premier Plans under Section 37, and what documentation is required to substantiate a claim within these limits?",
    "In what scenarios would quarantine or self-isolation orders mandated by the government for all travellers arriving into the country be excluded from coverage under Section 37, and how does this interact with other quarantine-related exclusions?",
    "How does the exclusion of quarantine not occurring within the Trip period affect claims under Section 37, especially in cases where quarantine extends beyond the planned travel dates?",
    "What are the implications of testing positive for a mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 diagnostic test prior to the Trip on the eligibility for benefits under Section 37, and how does this exclusion relate to other COVID-19 related exclusions?",
    "How does the requirement of being Fully Vaccinated impact the eligibility for claims under Section 37, and what documentation is necessary to prove vaccination status?",
    "If a traveller is subject to both Sections 36 and 37 for the same event, how does the policy determine which section's benefits are payable, and what are the conditions for making a claim under either section but not both?",
    "How do the exclusions under Section 37 interact with general policy-wide exclusions, particularly in cases involving quarantine due to government mandates or vaccination status?",
    "What constitutes being 'Fully Vaccinated' under this policy for the purpose of Section 37 claims, and are there any exceptions or exemptions to this requirement?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for quarantine costs if the quarantine is mandated after the Trip has commenced but extends beyond the original Trip period, considering the exclusion for quarantine not within the Trip?",
    "In cases where a traveller is quarantined due to exposure during the Trip but not by government mandate for all arrivals, would Section 37 benefits apply, and how do the exclusions clarify this scenario?",
    "What are the documentation and timing requirements for submitting a claim under Section 37, especially in relation to quarantine orders and vaccination proof?",
    "How does the policy address claims related to quarantine or self-isolation orders that are specific to the traveller (not mandated for all arrivals), and are such claims covered under Section 37 or excluded?",
    "If a traveller fails to meet the Fully Vaccinated requirement but has received partial vaccination, how does this affect claim eligibility under Section 37, and are there any provisions for such cases?",
    "How do the per day limits under Section 37 apply in cases of extended quarantine periods, and is there a maximum total benefit limit or duration specified?",
    "What is the impact of the exclusion for positive mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 tests on travellers who had to cancel or postpone their Trip, and how does this exclusion relate to claims under Sections 36 and 37?",
    "How does the policy define the 'Trip' period for the purpose of determining whether quarantine is within the Trip, and what evidence is required to establish this timeframe?",
    "In the event of overlapping claims under Sections 36 and 37 for the same COVID-19 related event, how does the policy ensure that benefits are not duplicated, and what is the process for claim adjudication?",
    "Are there any exceptions to the exclusion of quarantine mandated by government for all travellers arriving into the country, such as exemptions for medical reasons or travel through transit countries?",
    "How does the policy treat quarantine or self-isolation orders that are voluntary or recommended but not mandated by the government, in relation to Section 37 coverage and exclusions?",
    "What are the consequences for claimants if they fail to disclose their vaccination status or pre-departure test results when making a claim under Section 37, considering the exclusions listed?"
