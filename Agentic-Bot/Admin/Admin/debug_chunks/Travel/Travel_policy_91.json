    "How does the policy address trip cancellation due to witness summons or jury service that were unknown at the time of booking, and what documentation is required to support such claims?",
    "In what ways does compulsory quarantine of the insured or their travel companion qualify as a valid reason for trip cancellation, and how does this interact with any general exclusions related to quarantine or infectious diseases?",
    "What conditions must be met for serious damage to the insured's home in Singapore to justify trip cancellation, how is 'serious damage' defined or determined, and what is the relevant time frame for such damage relative to the trip departure date?",
    "How does the policy handle trip cancellation when the scheduled Common Carrier service is canceled for at least 24 hours due to strike, industrial action, riot, or civil commotion, and what exclusions apply if the event escalates to military or usurped power?",
    "If a compulsory quarantine is imposed after the trip has commenced, does the policy provide coverage for trip curtailment or interruption, and how does this relate to the quarantine clause for trip cancellation?",
    "What is the interplay between the fourteen-day window for serious home damage and the overall Period of Insurance, and how does this affect eligibility for trip cancellation claims?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between different types of civil disturbances such as riot, civil commotion, uprising, and military power in determining coverage for trip cancellation due to Common Carrier service disruption?",
    "Are there any requirements for notifying the insurer about witness summons or jury service obligations, and how does timing of such notifications affect claim validity?",
    "In cases where the insured's travel companion is subject to compulsory quarantine, how does the policy define 'Travel Companion,' and does this affect the insured's ability to claim trip cancellation benefits?",
    "What documentation or proof is required to substantiate claims of cancellation due to strike or industrial action affecting Common Carrier services, and how does the policy address partial delays versus full cancellations?",
    "How does the insurer exercise its sole discretion in determining 'serious damage' to the home, and what recourse does the insured have if there is disagreement over this determination?",
    "Does the policy provide any coverage or extensions if the Common Carrier cancellation due to industrial action lasts less than 24 hours, and how are such shorter disruptions treated under the policy terms?",
    "How are exclusions related to publicly known events or travel advisories reconciled with coverage for cancellation due to riot or civil commotion affecting Common Carrier services?",
    "If the insured's home suffers damage from a natural disaster exactly fourteen days before departure, how is the timing assessed for coverage eligibility, and does the policy consider the time of occurrence or the reporting date?",
    "How does the policy define 'Common Carrier,' and does this definition affect coverage for cancellations caused by strikes or riots impacting other forms of transportation not classified as Common Carriers?",

    "Are there any age or pre-existing condition limitations that affect coverage for trip cancellation due to compulsory quarantine or home damage, and how are these conditions documented?",
    "How does the policy treat situations where multiple cancellation reasons occur simultaneously, such as a compulsory quarantine coinciding with Common Carrier cancellation due to riot, in terms of claim processing and benefit limits?",
    "What are the implications of the policy's sole discretion clause on serious home damage for claims involving natural disasters, and how might this affect consistency in claim approvals?",
    "How does the policy address trip cancellation claims if the insured fails to inform the insurer about a witness summons or jury service obligation discovered after booking but before departure?"
