  "content": "If We allege that by reason of this exclusion, any loss, damage, cost or expense is not covered by this insurance the burden of proving the contrary shall be upon You.\n20. Nuclear weapons material or ionizing radiation or contamination by radioactivity from any nuclear fuel or from any nuclear waste from the combustion of nuclear fuel. For the purpose of this Exception, combustion shall include any self-sustaining process of nuclear fission.\n    * (a) permanent or temporary dispossession resulting from confiscation nationalisation commandeering or requisition by any lawfully constituted authority and/or\n    * (b) permanent or temporary dispossession of any property resulting from the unlawful occupation or possession of such property by any person provided that We are not relieved of any liability to You in respect of physical damage to the property insured occurring before dispossession or during temporary dispossession which is otherwise covered by this Policy",
  "questions": [
    "How does the burden of proof operate when the insurer alleges that a loss is excluded due to nuclear weapons material or ionizing radiation, and what must the insured demonstrate to counter this exclusion?",
    "In what ways does the exclusion related to nuclear fuel combustion apply to losses caused by ionizing radiation, and how is 'combustion' specifically defined in this context?",
    "How are losses resulting from permanent or temporary dispossession due to lawful confiscation or nationalisation treated under the policy, and what exceptions exist regarding physical damage to insured property?",
    "What conditions must be met for the insurer to remain liable for physical damage to property occurring before or during temporary dispossession caused by unlawful occupation?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between lawful and unlawful dispossession, and what impact does each have on coverage for loss or damage?",
    "Under the exclusion for nuclear-related losses, how are contamination claims from nuclear waste handled, especially if the contamination arises from a self-sustaining nuclear fission process?",
    "What documentation or evidence might the insured need to provide to prove that a loss allegedly excluded due to nuclear contamination is actually covered?",
    "How does the exclusion for nuclear weapons material interact with claims involving radioactive contamination from nuclear fuel combustion during a trip?",
    "In scenarios where property is temporarily requisitioned by a lawfully constituted authority, how does the policy address coverage for any resulting loss or damage?",
    "If physical damage to insured property occurs during temporary dispossession by unlawful occupants, how does the policy determine the insurer’s liability?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for loss or damage caused by ionizing radiation if the radiation source is nuclear waste versus nuclear fuel?",
    "What are the implications of the exclusion clause on claims involving contamination by radioactivity when the contamination is indirect or secondary to nuclear fuel combustion?",
    "How does the policy define the scope of 'lawfully constituted authority' in relation to dispossession exclusions, and how might this affect claim outcomes?",
    "In cases where the insured property is commandeered temporarily, what are the limits of coverage for damage occurring before, during, and after such dispossession?",
    "How does the exclusion for nuclear-related losses affect claims for costs or expenses arising from contamination cleanup or decontamination efforts?",
    "What is the insurer’s liability if physical damage occurs to insured property before it is confiscated or nationalised, and how must the insured substantiate such damage?",
    "How does the policy address the interplay between general exclusions for nuclear material and specific exclusions related to dispossession by authorities?",
    "In what ways might the insured challenge the insurer’s allegation that a loss is excluded under the nuclear weapons material or ionizing radiation clause, considering the burden of proof?",
    "How are losses from radioactive contamination treated if they occur during temporary unlawful occupation but physical damage happened prior to occupation?",
    "What are the policy implications if a loss involves both nuclear contamination and dispossession by a lawfully constituted authority—how are exclusions applied in such combined scenarios?"
