  "questions": [
    "How does the policy treat claims arising from wilful, malicious, criminal, or unlawful acts committed by the insured or someone acting on their behalf, and how does this general exclusion interact with claims related to extreme sports activities?",
    "In what circumstances is coverage provided for aerial activities, and what specific conditions must be met for flying to be considered covered under this policy section?",
    "How are claims handled if an insured participates in rafting or canoeing on white water rapids, and what documentation or proof might be required to establish whether the activity falls within the exclusion for extreme sports?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if the insured engages in bungee jumping or jet skiing during their trip, considering the policy's exclusion of certain extreme sports?",
    "How does the exclusion of ski racing, backcountry skiing, off-piste skiing, and ski jumping affect claims related to winter sports injuries, and are there any exceptions for recreational skiing on marked trails?",
    "If an insured is involved in hang gliding or parasailing, how does the policy exclusion apply, and what evidence would be necessary to confirm the activity's classification as an excluded extreme sport?",
    "How does the policy define and exclude activities such as the use of bobsleigh or skeleton, and what impact does this have on claims arising from injuries sustained during these sports?",
    "What are the coverage implications for hunting-related injuries under this policy, and how does this exclusion interact with any optional covers or endorsements that might be available?",
    "How does the exclusion of pot-holing and trekking above 3,000 metres affect claims for injuries sustained during high-altitude trekking, and what documentation is required to verify the altitude and activity type?",
    "What is the policy's stance on mountaineering and rock climbing requiring ropes or guides, and how does this exclusion affect claims for accidents occurring during these activities?",
    "How does the policy treat claims arising from extreme sports not explicitly listed but similar in risk to those mentioned, and what criteria determine whether an activity is classified as an extreme sport under this exclusion?",
    "In cases where an insured participates in multiple activities during a trip, some excluded and some covered, how does the policy determine coverage eligibility and claim settlement?",
    "How do the exclusions for extreme sports and unlawful acts interact if an insured commits a criminal act while engaging in an excluded activity, and which exclusion takes precedence?",
    "What documentation or evidence is required to prove that flying was conducted as a fare-paying passenger on a properly licensed, regular scheduled commercial airline to avoid exclusion under aerial activities?",
    "How does the policy handle claims if the insured participates in an aerial activity that is not a commercial airline flight, such as a private plane or charter, and what are the implications for coverage?",
    "Are there any exceptions or additional coverage options available for activities excluded under the extreme sports clause, and how can an insured obtain such coverage if desired?",
    "How does the exclusion of trekking above 3,000 metres affect claims for trekking at exactly 3,000 metres or slightly below, and what measurement standards are used to determine altitude?",
    "What is the impact of the exclusion for unlawful acts on claims involving third parties acting on behalf of the insured, and how is liability determined in such cases?",
    "How does the policy address claims arising from injuries sustained during activities that transition from non-excluded to excluded status, such as starting on a regular trail and moving into off-piste skiing?",
