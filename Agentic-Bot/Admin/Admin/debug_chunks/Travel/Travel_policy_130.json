    "Under Section 34, how does the requirement to rent the car from a licensed rental agency interact with the need to hold a valid driving license and be the named driver or co-driver for coverage eligibility?",
    "What are the implications for coverage under Section 34 if the rental car is insured under a comprehensive motor insurance policy not included as part of the rental agreement?",
    "How does non-adherence to the rental agreement’s terms, local laws, and regulations affect the eligibility for benefits under Section 34 in cases of rental car damage or loss?",
    "In what scenarios would damage caused by wear and tear, gradual deterioration, or built-in faults be excluded from benefits under Section 34, and how does this exclusion differ from damage caused by accidents?",
    "If a claimant is not the named driver but is driving the rental car with permission, how does Section 34 address the coverage of loss or damage in such a situation?",
    "How does the exclusion of coverage for damage caused by insects or vermin under Section 34 interact with claims for damage discovered after the rental period?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to demonstrate adherence to the rental agreement and local laws to avoid exclusions under Section 34?",
    "If a rental car is rented from an unlicensed agency but the driver holds a valid license and comprehensive insurance is purchased, is any benefit payable under Section 34?",
    "How does Section 34 handle claims if the driver violates the rental agreement’s terms but the damage is unrelated to the violation, such as accidental damage during permitted use?",
    "In cases where the rental car has pre-existing built-in faults or damage not obvious at the time of rental, how does Section 34’s exclusion apply to subsequent claims?",

    "How does Section 34 distinguish between damage caused by gradual deterioration and sudden accidental damage in determining benefit eligibility?",
    "If a co-driver is listed on the rental agreement but was not driving at the time of damage, does Section 34 provide coverage for the named driver’s liability?",

    "In the event of a dispute over whether the rental agency is licensed, how might this affect the claim under Section 34 and what proof is required?",
