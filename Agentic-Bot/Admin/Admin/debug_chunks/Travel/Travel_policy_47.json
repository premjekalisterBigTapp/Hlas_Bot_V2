  "content": "**\"Bodily Injury\"** means physical bodily injury to You occurring during the Trip caused solely and directly by an Accident and not by sickness, disease or gradual physical or mental wear and tear.\n\n**\"Child(ren)\"** means Your unemployed and unmarried dependent child(ren), including step or legally adopted child(ren), above three (3) months old but below eighteen (18) years or up to twenty-five (25) years of age, if studying full time in a recognized institution of higher learning at the commencement of this insurance. Age is calculated as at last birthday.\n\n**\"Common Carrier\"** means any land, sea or air transport provided and operated by a carrier or an airline which is duly licensed for the regular transportation of fare-paying passengers, operating on fixed routes and schedules. This excludes private hire/buses/coaches, taxis and all other modes of transportation that are chartered or arranged as part of a tour, even if the services are regularly scheduled.",
