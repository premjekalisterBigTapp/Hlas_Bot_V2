Excess reduction for repairs at Our Approved Workshop\nIf the Insured Vehicle is repaired at Our chosen Approved Workshop, Own Damage Excess will be halved.\n\n### EXCLUSIONS TO SECTION I\nWe shall not be liable to pay for:\n1.  (a) the Excess amount shown as Own Damage Excess in the Schedule and its applicable GST.\n    (b) Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess of S$3,000 and its applicable GST. The Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess is applicable in addition to the Own Damage Excess amount specified in the Schedule if the Insured Vehicle is driven by or under the control of any person (other than the Policyholder) who at the time of loss or damage to the Insured Vehicle is below twenty-seven (27) years of age and/or has held a valid driving license for less than two (2) years.\n\n    If We have made any payment under Section I which includes the excesses mentioned in (a) and/or (b) above, You have to pay Us the amount of the excesses.",
  "questions": [
    "How does repairing the Insured Vehicle at the Approved Workshop affect the Own Damage Excess, and what documentation or proof might be required to qualify for this reduction?",
    "In what scenarios would the Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess apply in addition to the Own Damage Excess, and how is the age and driving experience of the driver verified at the time of loss?",
    "What is the total excess payable if the Insured Vehicle is driven by a driver under 27 years old with less than two years of license holding, and the vehicle is not repaired at the Approved Workshop?",
    "How does the policy handle GST on both the Own Damage Excess and the Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess, and are these GST amounts recoverable or payable by the insured?",
    "If the Insured Vehicle is repaired at a non-approved workshop, what excess amounts are the insured responsible for, and are there any exceptions to this rule?",
    "Does the reduction of Own Damage Excess at the Approved Workshop apply if the driver is young or inexperienced, or is the Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess still fully payable in such cases?",
    "What are the implications for the insured if the insurer has already paid a claim including the Own Damage Excess and/or Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess, and how must the insured reimburse these amounts?",
    "How does the policy define 'Inexperienced Driver' in terms of license holding duration, and what evidence is required to establish this status at the time of loss?",
    "Are there any exclusions or limitations on the excess reduction benefit if the vehicle is repaired at the Approved Workshop but the driver is young or inexperienced?",
    "How does the policy treat excess payments when multiple drivers with different age and experience profiles are involved in the loss event?",
    "What is the interaction between the Own Damage Excess reduction and the Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess when both apply, and can the insured benefit from any combined reduction?",
    "If the vehicle is driven by the Policyholder who is under 27 years old or has less than two years of license holding, does the Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess still apply, and how is this handled under the policy?",
    "Are there any general policy exclusions that override the excess reduction benefit for repairs at the Approved Workshop, and how are these communicated to the insured?",
    "What procedures must the insured follow to ensure that repairs qualify for the excess reduction, and what happens if the insurer’s chosen Approved Workshop is unavailable?",
    "How does the policy address the timing of excess payments when the insurer has made a payment including excess amounts, and what are the insured’s obligations regarding repayment?",
    "Is the Own Damage Excess reduction applicable to all types of damage covered under Section I, or are there specific damage types excluded from this benefit?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where the driver’s age or license duration is borderline or disputed at the time of loss, particularly regarding the Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess?",
    "What is the impact on excess amounts if the vehicle is driven by a person other than the Policyholder who does not meet the age or experience criteria, and how is this verified?",
    "Are there any circumstances under which the insurer would waive the Young and/or Inexperienced Driver Excess despite the driver being under 27 or inexperienced, such as emergency situations?",
    "How does the policy ensure that the insured understands the additional excess charges and the conditions under which they apply, especially concerning young or inexperienced drivers?"
