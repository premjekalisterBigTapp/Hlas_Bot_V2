  "questions": [
    "How does the Authorised Repair Limit interact with the Excess when proceeding with motorcar repairs without insurer approval, and what is the maximum amount allowed for such repairs?",
    "In what ways can an Endorsement modify the coverage provided by the policy, and where can a policyholder find the specific Endorsements applicable to their policy?",
    "What is the role of the Excess in claims, how is it determined, and does it apply to each individual claim or aggregate claims within the policy period?",
    "Which geographical areas are covered under the Geographical Limits, and how do specific transit routes such as sea routes between Penang and mainland West Malaysia or Changi Point and Tanjong Belungkor affect coverage?",
    "If a motorcar repair estimate exceeds the Authorised Repair Limit of S$300, what steps must the insured take before proceeding with repairs, and how does this relate to the Excess?",
    "How might an Endorsement affect the application of the Excess or the Authorised Repair Limit within the policy, and can it override standard definitions provided in the Schedule or Certificate of Insurance?",
    "Does the Excess apply uniformly across all geographical areas defined in the Geographical Limits, including transit routes and border areas, or can it vary depending on location?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a claim arises from an incident occurring outside the defined Geographical Limits, such as beyond 80 kilometres from the Thailand-West Malaysia border?",
    "How is the Excess amount communicated to the insured, and can it be changed during the policy term through an Endorsement?",
    "In the context of the Authorised Repair Limit, how is the estimated repair cost determined, and what documentation might be required to support a claim within this limit?",
    "Are there any conditions under which the Authorised Repair Limit could be increased beyond S$300, such as through an Endorsement or special agreement?",
    "How do the defined Geographical Limits affect claims related to transit by sea routes, and what documentation or proof might be necessary to establish that an incident occurred within these limits?",
    "If a claim involves damage occurring within the part of Thailand covered by the policy, how is the 80-kilometre boundary measured and verified for coverage eligibility?",
    "Can the Excess amount differ for incidents occurring in Singapore versus West Malaysia or the specified transit routes, and how would this be reflected in the Schedule or Certificate of Insurance?",
    "What is the relationship between the Excess and the Authorised Repair Limit when a repair cost is exactly S$300, and does the insured still need insurer approval to proceed?",
    "How does the policy define the term 'You' in relation to bearing the Excess and proceeding with repairs under the Authorised Repair Limit?",
    "In what scenarios would an Endorsement be issued to change the Geographical Limits, and how would this impact existing claims or coverage periods?",
    "If a claim is made for an incident occurring during transit across the straits between Changi Point and Tanjong Belungkor, what specific policy provisions apply regarding Excess and repair authorisation?",
    "How does the policy ensure that insured parties are aware of the Excess amount and any applicable Endorsements that modify their coverage or obligations?",
    "What procedures must be followed if the estimated repair costs are below the Excess amount, and how does this affect the insured's decision to claim or proceed with repairs?"
