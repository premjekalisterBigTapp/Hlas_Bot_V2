Conditions Precedent to the Company's Liability\nThe due observance and fulfilment of the Terms of this Policy insofar as they relate to anything to be done or not to be done by You or any person claiming to be indemnified, and the truth of the statements and answers in the application, shall be conditions precedent to any liability of Us to make any payment under this Policy.\n\n#### 8. Legal Representative\nThe Terms of this Policy, so far as applicable and with any necessary modifications, shall apply to the legal personal representative of the Policyholder and Authorised Driver.\n\n#### 9. Written Notice\nEvery notice or communication to be given or made under this Policy shall be delivered in writing to Us.\n\n### GENERAL EXCLUSIONS\n*(Applicable to the whole Policy)*",
  "questions": [
    "How does the requirement for due observance and fulfilment of policy terms by the insured or indemnified persons act as a condition precedent to the insurer's liability, and what role does the truthfulness of application statements play in this context?",
    "In what ways do the conditions precedent affect claims made by persons other than the Policyholder, such as authorised drivers or other indemnified individuals?",
    "How are the policy terms adapted and applied to the legal personal representative of the Policyholder or Authorised Driver, and what modifications might be necessary for this application?",
    "What are the implications for claim submission and communication if notices or communications are not delivered in writing to the insurer as required by the policy?",
    "How do the conditions precedent interact with the General Exclusions applicable to the entire policy in determining the insurer’s liability?",
    "If a claim is made by a legal personal representative, how must they comply with the policy terms and conditions, and how does this affect the insurer’s obligations?",
    "What are the consequences if any person claiming indemnity under the policy fails to observe or fulfil any of the policy terms or provides untruthful statements in the application?",
    "How does the policy define the process and requirements for giving written notice, and what might be the effect of failing to comply with this requirement on claim processing?",
    "In scenarios where multiple persons are indemnified under the policy, how does the insurer ensure that the conditions precedent are met by all parties involved before making any payment?",
    "How might the requirement for written communication affect the timeliness and validity of claims or other notices under the policy?",
    "What is the relationship between the conditions precedent and the General Exclusions, and can a breach of either independently void the insurer’s liability?",
    "How does the policy ensure that the legal personal representative is bound by the same terms and conditions as the original insured or authorised driver, especially in the event of a claim after the insured’s death?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to demonstrate compliance with the conditions precedent, particularly the truth of statements in the application, when submitting a claim?",
    "How does the policy address situations where notices or communications are sent verbally or by electronic means instead of in writing, and what impact does this have on claims?",
    "In the event of a dispute over the truthfulness of statements made in the application, how does the condition precedent clause affect the insurer’s decision to indemnify?",
    "How do the conditions precedent apply when the claim involves actions or omissions by an authorised driver rather than the Policyholder themselves?",
    "What are the potential effects on coverage if the legal personal representative fails to observe the policy terms or provide written notice as required?",
    "How does the policy define the scope of ‘written notice’ and are there any specified methods or addresses for delivering such notices to the insurer?",
    "In what ways might the General Exclusions override or complement the conditions precedent in limiting or excluding the insurer’s liability?",
    "How does the insurer verify that all persons claiming indemnity have complied with the conditions precedent before processing a claim, and what evidence is typically required?"
