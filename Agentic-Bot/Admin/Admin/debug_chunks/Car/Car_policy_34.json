  "questions": [
    "How does the age eligibility criteria for the insured driver and passengers affect the coverage for death or bodily injury under this policy, and what are the implications if these age limits are not met at the time of injury?",
    "In what ways does the requirement that death or bodily injury must occur within three calendar months of the accident impact claims, especially when considering medical or surgical treatments following the injury?",
    "How does the policy handle claims if the insured has multiple private motor car insurance policies with the insurer, and what are the conditions for payment under these circumstances?",
    "What is the significance of the phrase 'independent of any other cause except medical or surgical treatment consequent upon such injury' in determining the validity of a claim for death or bodily injury?",
    "How do the age restrictions for passengers differ from those for the insured driver, and what scenarios could arise if a passenger is outside the specified age range at the time of injury?",
    "If an injury occurs but death happens after the three-month window, how does the policy treat such a claim, particularly in relation to ongoing medical treatments?",
    "How might the policy's limitation to payment under only one private motor car insurance policy affect a claimant who holds multiple policies with the insurer for the same vehicle?",
    "What documentation or proof might be necessary to establish that the death or bodily injury occurred within the specified three-month period and was a direct result of the accident?",
    "How does the policy define 'Authorised Driver' in relation to the age limits, and what are the consequences if an unauthorised driver outside the age range causes injury?",
    "In cases where the insured vehicle carries multiple passengers, how does the age eligibility of each passenger influence the overall claim for bodily injury or death?",
    "What are the potential exclusions or limitations if the injury or death results from causes other than the accident or subsequent medical treatment within the three-month timeframe?",
    "How does the policy address claims involving passengers who are exactly at the minimum or maximum age limits (16 or 65 years) at the time of injury?",
    "If a passenger is injured in the insured vehicle but is under sixteen years old, how does this affect the claim under this policy provision?",
    "How does the policy's age criteria interact with other general exclusions that might apply to bodily injury or death claims in motor vehicle accidents?",
    "What are the implications for claims if the insured driver is younger than eighteen or older than sixty-five at the time of the accident?",
    "How does the policy ensure that payments are not duplicated when multiple policies exist, and what procedures might be in place to determine which policy pays the claim?",
    "In the event of a fatal accident, how does the policy verify that death occurred within the three-month limit and was not due to unrelated causes?",
    "How does the policy treat injuries sustained by passengers who are within the age limits but are not authorised drivers, especially in multi-passenger scenarios?",
    "What are the consequences if the bodily injury occurs within three months but the insured or passenger receives medical treatment that extends beyond this period?",
    "How might the policy's age and timing conditions affect claims involving elderly passengers or drivers who are at the upper age limit and suffer delayed complications from an accident?"
