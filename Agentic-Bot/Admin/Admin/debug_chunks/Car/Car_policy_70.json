  "content": "Any conviction against the driver for an offence under Section 67 to 71A of the Road Traffic Act (Cap.92.1985 Ed.) and/or any statutory law regarding the abuse of drugs, shall be conclusive evidence for the exception stated at General Exclusion 1(b)(iii) above to apply where the offence was committed at the time of an accident or event giving rise to claim under this Policy.\n2. Any liability that You have agreed to take on under an agreement, which You would not otherwise have if the agreement did not exist.\n3. Any claim or provide any benefit hereunder to the extent that the provision of such cover, payment of such claim or provision of such benefit would expose Us to any sanction, prohibition or restriction under United Nations resolutions or the trade or economic sanctions, laws or regulations of the European Union or United Kingdom or United States of America.",

    "How does the policy handle claims arising from liabilities voluntarily assumed by the insured through agreements that would otherwise not be covered?",
    "In cases where payment of a claim would violate international sanctions, what procedures does the insurer follow to deny or restrict coverage?",
    "Can the insurer deny a claim if the insured was convicted of a relevant offence but the conviction occurred after the accident date, and how does timing affect this exclusion?",
