    "Under what conditions is the daily transport allowance of S$50 payable, and how does the repair period recommended by the appointed surveyor or loss adjuster affect the maximum duration of this benefit?",
    "How does the transport allowance interact with the coverage of Section I of the policy, and what types of vehicle damage qualify for this allowance?",
    "If the repair period recommended is exactly three days, is the transport allowance payable, and what is the minimum repair period required to trigger this benefit?",
    "What documentation or evidence is required from the appointed surveyor or loss adjuster to validate the repair period and qualify for the transport allowance?",
    "How is the maximum limit of ten days for the transport allowance applied if the repair period exceeds this duration, and are partial days counted as full days?",

    "If the repair period is extended beyond the initial recommendation by the surveyor or loss adjuster, can the transport allowance be extended accordingly, and what is the process for approval?",
    "Are there any general policy exclusions that would override the payment of the transport allowance even if the repair period criteria are met?",
    "How does the transport allowance benefit apply if the vehicle damage is caused by an excluded peril under Section I, and what documentation is needed to prove coverage?",
    "Is the transport allowance payable if the insured chooses not to repair the vehicle despite the surveyor’s recommendation, and how does this affect the claim?",
    "What happens if the appointed surveyor or loss adjuster is not available or does not provide a repair period recommendation—can the insured still claim the transport allowance?",

    "If the repair period is shortened due to expedited repairs or parts availability, how is the transport allowance adjusted, and what proof is required?",
    "Does the transport allowance apply if the vehicle is damaged but deemed a total loss, and how is the repair period interpreted in such cases?",
    "How does the policy handle disputes regarding the repair period recommended by the appointed surveyor or loss adjuster in relation to the transport allowance claim?",
