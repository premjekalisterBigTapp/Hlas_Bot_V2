  "content": "#### 4. Payment to Legal Owners\nIf the Insured Vehicle is owned by someone else (for example, under a hire purchase or leasing agreement or an employer's loan) and the legal owner is named in the Policy, We may settle the claim, for loss of or damage to the Insured Vehicle (which is not made good by repair, reinstatement or replacement) in cash directly with such legal owner. Their acceptance shall absolve Us of all further liability.\n\n#### 5. Arbitration\nIf there is any dispute as to the amount to be paid under this Policy (liability being otherwise admitted) such dispute shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the statutory provisions on arbitration in that behalf for the time being in force. It is hereby expressly stipulated that it shall be a condition precedent to any right of action or suit upon this Policy that an arbitration award shall be first obtained.",
