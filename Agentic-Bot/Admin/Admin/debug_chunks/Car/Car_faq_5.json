  "content": "Q: If I am not at fault for the accident but make an own damage claim, will my NCD be affected?\nA: Your NCD will not be affected if we can recover the claim amount from the other party. However, if the claim recovery is not successful, your NCD will be affected. Alternatively, if you have been successful in your counter claim for excess and loss of use (at least 80% success rate), we can look into your request to reinstate NCD, subject to supporting documents.",
