  "content": "Payment by Us under this sub-section 1-2 will not affect Your No Claim Discount (NCD). However, We will not pay for the cost of the solar film or similar as a result of replacing the Windscreen.\n\n#### 3. Protection and Removal after Accident\nIf the Insured Vehicle is immobilised by reason of loss or damage insured under this Policy, We will bear the reasonable cost of up to S$500 for protection and removal to the nearest repairers and for delivery within the Geographical Limits.\n\n#### 4. Authority to Repair\nThe Policyholder may authorise the repair of the Insured Vehicle necessitated by damage for which We may be liable under this Policy provided that:\n(a) the estimated cost of such repair does not exceed the Authorised Repair Limit and\n(b) a detailed estimate of the cost is forwarded to Us without delay.\n\n#### 5. Excess reduction for repairs at Our Approved Workshop\nIf the Insured Vehicle is repaired at Our chosen Approved Workshop, Own Damage Excess will be halved.",
