    "In cases where the Insured Vehicle is subject to a Leasing Agreement, how does the policy distinguish between the rights and responsibilities of the Policyholder and the Lessors in the event of a claim?",

    "What documentation or evidence might the insurance company require to verify the existence and terms of the Leasing Agreement before making payments to the Lessors?",
    "How does the policy clause regarding payment to the Lessors interact with any general exclusions or conditions that might apply under Section I or the overall policy?",
