  "content": "The excesses mentioned above are applicable for every claim made under Section I of this Policy for loss of or damage to the Insured Vehicle but shall not apply to loss or damage to the Insured Vehicle caused by fire, external explosion, self-ignition, lightning, burglary, housebreaking or theft except if it is stated to be applicable in the Schedule.\n2.  loss of use or any other consequential loss.\n3.  (a) depreciation, wear and tear, mechanical or electronic breakdown, equipment or computer malfunction,\n    (b) the failure or inability of any equipment or any computer program to recognise or correctly interpret or process any date as the true or correct date or to continue to function correctly beyond that date,\n4.  damage to tyres or rims unless damage is caused to other parts of the Insured Vehicle simultaneously in the same accident.\n5.  any loss or damage arising from a criminal breach of trust.",
  "questions": [
    "How do the excesses apply to claims for loss or damage to the Insured Vehicle under Section I, and in what specific fire or theft-related scenarios are these excesses waived according to the Schedule?",
    "In what ways are losses related to loss of use or consequential losses excluded from coverage under Section I, and how might this affect claims following an accident?",
    "How does the policy address exclusions related to depreciation, wear and tear, and mechanical or electronic breakdown, and what implications does this have for claims involving equipment or computer malfunctions?",
    "What are the conditions under which damage to tyres or rims is covered, particularly when such damage occurs simultaneously with damage to other parts of the Insured Vehicle in the same accident?",
    "How does the exclusion of losses arising from criminal breach of trust affect claims under Section I, and what documentation might be required to establish the nature of the loss?",
    "If the Insured Vehicle suffers damage from lightning or external explosion, how do the excesses and exclusions apply, and what role does the Schedule play in determining excess applicability?",
    "In cases where the Insured Vehicle experiences a computer program failure related to date recognition or processing, how does the policy exclude coverage, and what are the potential impacts on claim eligibility?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between damage caused by theft or burglary and damage caused by other perils in terms of excess application and coverage exclusions?",
    "What is the significance of the excess not applying to loss or damage caused by self-ignition, and how might this exclusion interact with other general policy exclusions?",
    "How are claims affected if the damage to the Insured Vehicle's tyres or rims occurs independently of other vehicle damage, and what exceptions exist for such scenarios?",
    "In the event of a claim involving mechanical breakdown, how does the policy's exclusion of wear and tear and equipment malfunction influence the assessment of the claim?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where the Insured Vehicle's damage results from a combination of excluded causes, such as theft combined with mechanical failure, in relation to excesses and coverage?",
    "What documentation or proof might be necessary to demonstrate that damage to the Insured Vehicle was caused by fire or burglary to benefit from the waiver of excesses?",
    "How does the exclusion of loss of use or consequential loss interact with claims for physical damage to the Insured Vehicle, and what limitations does this impose on claim recoveries?",
    "In what circumstances would the excess be stated as applicable in the Schedule despite the general waiver for fire or theft-related losses, and how should insured persons verify this?",
    "How does the policy's exclusion of damage due to the failure of equipment to process dates correctly relate to broader exclusions on electronic or computer malfunctions?",
    "What are the implications of the criminal breach of trust exclusion for claims involving theft or misappropriation by employees or third parties?",
    "How does the policy treat damage caused by lightning in relation to other natural perils, and what exclusions or excess waivers apply?",
    "If an insured experiences damage to the vehicle's tyres during an accident that also damages the vehicle body, how does the policy determine coverage and excess application?",
    "How do the exclusions for depreciation and wear and tear affect claims for damage that may be partially due to an accident and partially due to pre-existing mechanical issues?"
