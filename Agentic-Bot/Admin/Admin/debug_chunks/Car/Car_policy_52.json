  "content": "#### 6. Changing Your Policy\nYou may request Us to change a term in Your Policy. The change takes place only when We confirm it in writing to You or endorse it on Your Schedule, and You pay any additional premium that We require.\n\n#### 7. What can Affect Your Entitlement\nIf You do not comply with any condition of Your Policy, it may affect the coverage and benefits afforded by this Policy.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the process of changing a policy term, including the requirement for written confirmation and payment of additional premium, interact with the potential impact on coverage if policy conditions are not complied with?",
    "What are the specific steps and documentation required for a policyholder to request and have a policy term changed, and how might failure to follow these steps affect their entitlement to benefits?",
    "In what ways can non-compliance with policy conditions influence the insurer's obligation to confirm requested changes in writing or endorse them on the policy schedule?",
    "How does the insurer's confirmation in writing or endorsement on the schedule serve as a control mechanism to ensure policyholders meet conditions before changes take effect?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if a policyholder requests a change but fails to pay the additional premium required by the insurer?",
    "How might a policyholder's failure to comply with conditions affect the insurer's willingness or obligation to approve requested policy changes?",
    "Can a policyholder assume that a requested change is effective before receiving written confirmation or endorsement, and how does this assumption impact entitlement to benefits?",
    "What types of policy terms are typically subject to change requests, and how does the insurer verify compliance with conditions before approving such changes?",
    "How does the timing of payment for additional premiums relate to the effective date of the policy change and the continuation of coverage?",
    "If a policyholder partially complies with conditions but misses certain requirements, how does this partial compliance affect both entitlement and the process of changing policy terms?",
    "What role does the insurer's written confirmation or schedule endorsement play in resolving disputes about whether a policy change was authorized and effective?",
    "How might the insurer handle a situation where a policyholder requests a change but the policyholder's non-compliance with other conditions affects their overall entitlement?",
    "Are there any scenarios where a policy change can be considered effective without written confirmation or payment, and how would this affect claims under the policy?",
    "How do the requirements for changing a policy term ensure that both parties have clear agreement, and what risks arise if these requirements are not strictly followed?",
    "In what ways can the insurer's discretion in confirming changes be influenced by the policyholder's adherence to all policy conditions?",
    "How does the clause about changes to policy terms interact with general exclusions or other sections that might limit coverage due to non-compliance?",
    "What are the potential consequences for a policyholder who requests a change but fails to meet the payment or confirmation conditions, especially in the event of a claim?",
    "How does the policy define the relationship between compliance with conditions and entitlement to benefits when a policy term change is involved?",
    "What documentation or proof might the insurer require to confirm that a policyholder has complied with conditions before approving a change?",
    "How might timing issues, such as delays in confirmation or payment, affect the effective date of a policy change and the policyholder's coverage?"
