Interests of Other Persons\nYou must not transfer or assign Your interest in the Policy to another person without first obtaining Our written consent. If anyone else has an interest in Your Policy (for example, the legal owner of Your car through a hire purchase or leasing agreement or employer's loan), We are bound to extend the insurance to them only after You have informed Us about their interest in writing and We have agreed in writing to enter their name and interest on Your Policy. However, Our doing so does not make You an agent or trustee for them or assign Your rights and interests to them.",
