    "In what ways does the policy exclude coverage for death or bodily injury resulting from intentional self-injury, suicide, or attempted suicide, and how does this exclusion apply regardless of the legal status of the act?",
    "How are claims affected if the death or bodily injury arises from a physical or mental defect or infirmity, and what documentation might be required to establish such a condition?",
    "What are the policy’s exclusions related to accidents occurring while the driver is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, and how might this exclusion interact with legal or police reports?",
    "If a bodily injury manifests or death occurs more than three calendar months after the accident, how does the policy treat such claims, and are there any exceptions to this time limit?",
    "How does the policy define the term 'accident' in relation to the exclusions for intoxicated driving and intentional self-injury, and what impact does this have on claim assessment?",
    "In cases where multiple policies exist, how does the insurer determine which single policy will provide payment, and what happens to claims under the other policies?",
    "How does the exclusion for death or bodily injury due to mental defects or infirmity apply if the condition was unknown or undiagnosed at the time of the accident?",

    "How does the policy treat claims arising from attempted suicide if the attempt was not felonious, and what distinctions does the policy make regarding the nature of the act?",
    "If a claim involves both intentional self-injury and intoxicated driving, how do the exclusions apply, and which exclusion takes precedence?",
    "Are there any provisions or exceptions for claims involving death or bodily injury resulting from accidents occurring within the three-month window but complicated by pre-existing physical or mental infirmities?",
    "How does the policy address claims for bodily injury if the driver was under the influence but the accident was caused by a third party, and does the exclusion still apply?",
    "What is the policy’s stance on claims for death or bodily injury if the driver was intoxicated but the accident occurred outside the insured vehicle’s operation?",
    "How does the insurer verify the timing of death or bodily injury relative to the accident date to enforce the three-month claim limit?",
    "In the event of multiple claims arising from the same accident under different policies held by the insured, how does the single payment rule affect the total compensation?",
    "What are the implications of the exclusion clauses on claims involving mental health conditions that may have contributed indirectly to the accident?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for bodily injury or death if the driver was under prescribed medication that could cause impairment but was not classified as intoxicating drugs?",
