    "In what scenarios would claims related to vibration, interference with land or building support, subsidence, or earth movement be excluded, and how does this interact with coverage for property damage?",
    "How does the policy treat claims based on express or implied warranties or agreements, and under what conditions would liability still be recognized despite such warranties or agreements?",
    "What is the impact of excluding punitive and exemplary damages awarded against the insured or their maid on the overall liability coverage, and are compensatory damages still covered?",

    "What are the limitations on court judgments as a basis for claims, specifically regarding judgments not delivered by a Singapore court, and how does this affect claims arising from foreign legal decisions?",
    "How does the exclusion of court judgments currently under appeal by the insured or their family members influence the timing and eligibility of claims related to those judgments?",
    "In cases involving vehicles, how does the exclusion differentiate between garden appliances that require registration and those that do not, and what coverage implications arise from this distinction?",
    "How do exclusions related to earth movement and subsidence interact with claims for structural damage caused by natural disasters, and are there any exceptions for insured peril coverage?",

    "How does the policy handle claims based on foreign court judgments, and what are the requirements for a judgment to be recognized for claim purposes within Singapore?",
    "In situations where a court judgment is under appeal, how does this exclusion affect the insured's ability to claim related damages or liabilities, and what is the process once the appeal is resolved?",
    "How do the exclusions related to vehicles, watercraft, and aircraft apply when these are used temporarily or borrowed, and does the policy distinguish between ownership and use in these cases?",
    "What is the rationale behind excluding claims arising from vibration or interference with land or building support, and how might this affect claims related to construction or excavation activities?",
    "How does the policy define the scope of punitive and exemplary damages, and what types of damages are explicitly excluded or included under this clause?",
    "In the context of court judgments, how does the policy treat judgments delivered outside Singapore but enforced within Singapore, and does enforcement affect claim eligibility?",
