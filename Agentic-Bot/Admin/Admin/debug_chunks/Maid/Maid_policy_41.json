  "content": "**\"Permanent Total Disablement\"** means a disability caused by an Accident as long as the disability lasts for twelve (12) consecutive months from the date of the Accident, prevents Your Maid from engaging in any kind of occupation or employment for remuneration or profit and at the expiry of that period our appointed Registered Medical Practitioner confirms that the disability is not going to improve after twelve (12) months. We will pay the principal sum insured less any other amount paid or payable under the policy as the result of the same Accident.\n\n**\"Personal Belongings\"** means articles of personal use designed specifically to be worn or carried by a person e.g clothing, jewellery, watches and camera equipment etc. excluding money, mobile phones, pagers, personal computers and items which are used in connection with any business profession or employment, as well as items insured under a separate policy whether taken with Us or with another insurance company.",
