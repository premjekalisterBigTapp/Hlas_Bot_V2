  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address claims involving consequential loss or damage, and how does this general exclusion interact with other section-specific benefits?",
    "In what ways are injuries or illnesses resulting from air travel covered or excluded, particularly when considering travel as a fare-paying passenger on licensed commercial airlines versus other aerial activities?",
    "What are the implications for coverage if an injury occurs during rafting or canoeing on white water rapids, and how does this exclusion apply to other listed high-risk sports such as bungee jumping or jet skiing?",
    "How does the policy treat injuries sustained from underwater activities involving artificial breathing apparatus, and what documentation or proof might be required to establish the nature of the activity for claims?",
    "What exclusions apply to injuries from ski-related activities, distinguishing between ski racing, backcountry skiing, off-piste skiing, ski jumping, and skiing on man-made walls?",
    "How are injuries from motor sports or racing activities other than on foot handled under the policy, and what conditions might affect claim eligibility for such events?",
    "What is the policy stance on injuries caused by hunting, pot-holing, mountaineering, or rock climbing, especially when ropes or guides are ordinarily required, and how does this affect claims for climbing on man-made walls?",
    "How does the exclusion for suicide, attempted suicide, self-injury, or wilful exposure to peril impact claims, and are there any exceptions such as attempts to save human life?",
    "If a claimant is injured during parasailing or parachuting, how does the policy exclusion affect coverage, and what evidence might be necessary to confirm the activity involved?",
    "How does the policy define and exclude injuries from hang gliding and parasailing, and what are the implications for travelers participating in these activities during their trip?",
    "In cases where injury results from water skiing or the use of bobsleigh or skeleton, how does the exclusion clause apply, and are there any circumstances under which coverage might still be considered?",
    "What are the consequences for claims involving injuries sustained during racing events that are trials of speed or reliability, and how does this differ from racing on foot?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between injuries caused by air travel as a fare-paying passenger and other aerial activities, and what documentation is required to prove the nature of the flight?",
    "What is the impact of the exclusion for consequential loss or damage on claims related to indirect costs arising from an injury or illness covered under other sections?",
    "How do the exclusions for high-risk sports and activities interact with any optional covers or riders that might be available for hazardous activities?",
    "In the event of an injury caused by self-injury or wilful exposure to peril, how does the policy determine the intent, and what evidence is necessary to support or deny a claim?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for injuries sustained during activities that are borderline between excluded and included categories, such as recreational canoeing on calm waters versus white water rapids?",
    "What role do licensed commercial airports and regular scheduled commercial airlines play in determining coverage for air travel-related injuries?",
    "How does the policy address the timing and reporting requirements for injuries resulting from excluded activities, and what are the implications for claim submission deadlines?",
    "In what ways do the general exclusions for consequential loss and specific exclusions for certain activities affect the overall risk assessment and premium calculation for the insured?"
