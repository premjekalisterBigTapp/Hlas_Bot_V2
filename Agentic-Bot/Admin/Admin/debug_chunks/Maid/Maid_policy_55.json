  "content": "In the event Your Maid is hospitalized due to any Injury or Illness diagnosed prior to the first Policy issued by Us and Your Maid has been employed as a foreign domestic worker for a Continuous Period in Singapore, We will pay up to the maximum of $60,000, subjected to 25% co-payment in excess of $15,000.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this is regardless of the plan type and/or Additional Hospital & Surgical Expenses benefit Your Maid is covered for.\n\n**Change of Coverage**\nIf there is a change of the plan type and/or Additional Hospital & Surgical Expenses is included into the Policy after any Injury or Illness is diagnosed and then a claim is made subsequently, We will pay up to the Annual Sub-Limit as specified in the Policy Schedule prior to the changes, subjected to 25% co-payment in excess of $15,000 as applicable.\n\n**Extension under Section 2: (Applicable for Enhanced, Premier or Exclusive Plan)**",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy handle hospitalization claims for a Maid with a pre-existing Injury or Illness diagnosed before the first policy issuance, including the maximum payout, co-payment, and excess amounts?",
    "In what way does the Maid’s continuous employment period in Singapore affect the coverage of pre-existing conditions under this policy?",
    "How does the coverage for pre-existing conditions apply across different plan types and Additional Hospital & Surgical Expenses benefits?",
    "What happens to the coverage limits and co-payment if the plan type or Additional Hospital & Surgical Expenses benefit is changed after the diagnosis of an Injury or Illness but before a claim is made?",
    "When there is a change in plan type or inclusion of Additional Hospital & Surgical Expenses after diagnosis, how is the Annual Sub-Limit prior to the change used to determine claim payment?",
    "How does the 25% co-payment in excess of $15,000 apply differently when the claim is made under the original plan versus after a plan change?",
    "What documentation or proof might be required to establish the continuous employment period of the Maid in Singapore for pre-existing condition claims?",
    "How does the policy define the timing of diagnosis in relation to the first policy issuance for determining coverage of pre-existing conditions?",
    "If a Maid is hospitalized for a condition diagnosed before the first policy but the policyholder switches to an Enhanced, Premier, or Exclusive Plan, how does the extension under Section 2 affect the claim?",
    "How do the general policy exclusions interact with this specific pre-existing condition coverage for the Maid’s hospitalization?",
    "In the event of multiple hospitalizations for the same pre-existing condition, how does the maximum payout of $60,000 and co-payment apply across claims?",
    "If the Maid’s Injury or Illness was diagnosed prior to the first policy but the policyholder cancels and reinstates the policy, how does this affect the coverage for that condition?",
    "How does the policy treat claims for pre-existing conditions if the Maid was not continuously employed in Singapore but had breaks in employment?",
    "What are the implications for claim payment if the policyholder adds Additional Hospital & Surgical Expenses coverage after the Maid’s diagnosis but before hospitalization?",
    "How does the policy ensure that the 25% co-payment and $15,000 excess are applied correctly when the claim amount is close to or below these thresholds?",
    "If a claim is made for a pre-existing condition under a plan without Additional Hospital & Surgical Expenses, but the policyholder later upgrades the plan, how is the claim limit determined?",
    "How does the policy address scenarios where the Maid’s Injury or Illness was diagnosed after the first policy issuance but before the inclusion of Additional Hospital & Surgical Expenses coverage?",
    "What are the conditions under which the Annual Sub-Limit prior to plan changes takes precedence over new coverage limits for pre-existing conditions?",
    "How does the policy’s co-payment and excess structure for pre-existing conditions compare to other illness or injury claims not diagnosed prior to the first policy?",
    "What specific benefits or limitations are introduced by the Extension under Section 2 for Enhanced, Premier, or Exclusive Plans concerning pre-existing conditions?"
