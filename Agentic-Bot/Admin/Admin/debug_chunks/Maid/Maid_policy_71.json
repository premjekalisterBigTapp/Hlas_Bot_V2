  "content": "**(i) Definition of Critical Illness**\nFor the purpose of this Policy and notwithstanding any other definition which may be found elsewhere, \"Critical Illness\" means any of the conditions or illnesses defined as follows:\n\n**1. Major Cancers**\nA malignant tumour positively diagnosed with histological confirmation and characterized by the uncontrolled growth of malignant cells with invasion and destruction of normal tissue.\n\nThe term malignant tumour includes leukaemia, lymphoma and sarcoma.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define 'Critical Illness' specifically in relation to major cancers, and what diagnostic criteria must be met for a malignant tumour to qualify?",
    "What types of cancers are explicitly included under the definition of major cancers in the Critical Illness section, and how does the policy address their pathological confirmation?",
    "In the context of this policy, how is histological confirmation used to establish a diagnosis of major cancer for Critical Illness claims, and what documentation would be required to support this?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between malignant tumours and other types of growths or illnesses when defining Critical Illness, and what implications does this have for claim eligibility?",
    "What is the significance of the terms 'uncontrolled growth,' 'invasion,' and 'destruction of normal tissue' in the policy’s definition of major cancers under Critical Illness, and how might these criteria affect claim assessments?",
    "Are leukaemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma treated differently or given special consideration under the policy’s definition of major cancers for Critical Illness coverage, and what proof is required to confirm these diagnoses?",
    "How might the policy’s definition of Critical Illness for major cancers interact with general exclusions or pre-existing condition clauses, especially regarding the timing of diagnosis and confirmation?",
    "If a tumour is diagnosed but lacks histological confirmation, how would this affect the eligibility for a Critical Illness claim under the major cancers definition in the policy?",
    "Does the policy provide any guidance on how to handle borderline or early-stage malignant tumours in relation to the Critical Illness major cancers definition, particularly concerning the criteria of tissue invasion and destruction?",
    "How does the inclusion of specific cancer types like leukaemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma within the Critical Illness definition impact the scope of coverage compared to other cancers not explicitly mentioned?",
    "What role does the policy’s definition of Critical Illness play in determining coverage limits or benefit payments for claims related to major cancers?",
    "How might the policy address situations where a diagnosis of a malignant tumour is revised or downgraded after initial histological confirmation in relation to Critical Illness claims?",
    "In cases where a claimant has multiple tumours, how does the policy’s definition of Critical Illness for major cancers determine which tumours qualify for coverage?",
    "How does the policy ensure that the diagnosis of major cancers under Critical Illness is consistent with medical standards, and what are the implications for claims involving rare or unusual cancer types?",
    "What documentation and timing requirements might the policy impose to verify the histological confirmation of a malignant tumour for a Critical Illness claim?",
    "How does the policy’s definition of Critical Illness for major cancers interact with any vaccination or pre-existing condition exclusions that might apply to cancer diagnoses?",
    "In the event of a dispute over whether a tumour meets the policy’s definition of a malignant tumour for Critical Illness, what procedures or expert opinions does the policy suggest or require?",
    "How does the policy treat cancers that are detected incidentally or through screening but have not yet caused tissue invasion or destruction in the context of Critical Illness coverage?",
    "What are the implications of the policy’s Critical Illness definition for claims involving cancers that are in remission or have been treated successfully prior to the policy inception date?",
    "How does the policy’s definition of Critical Illness for major cancers address the timing of diagnosis relative to the policy effective date, especially for cancers diagnosed shortly after coverage begins?"
