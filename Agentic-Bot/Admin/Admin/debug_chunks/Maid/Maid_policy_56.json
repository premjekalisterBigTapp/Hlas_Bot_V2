  "questions": [
    "How does the Hospital Cash benefit under Section 2 apply specifically to the Maid's consecutive hospital confinement, and what are the maximum duration and payment limits?",
    "In what way does the Hospital Cash benefit differ for Enhanced, Premier, or Exclusive Plans compared to other plans, and how does this affect claim eligibility?",
    "What documentation and proof are required to substantiate each consecutive twenty-four-hour hospital confinement period for the Maid to claim the Hospital Cash benefit?",
    "How does the Annual Sub-Limit interact with the daily Hospital Cash payments when the Maid is hospitalized for more than thirty consecutive days?",
    "If the Maid is hospitalized intermittently with breaks shorter than twenty-four hours, how is the Hospital Cash benefit calculated under this extension?",
    "Are there any general or section-specific exclusions that would prevent payment of the Hospital Cash benefit for the Maid’s hospital confinement under this extension?",
    "How does the Hospital Cash benefit handle situations where the Maid is hospitalized overseas versus in Singapore, considering any possible policy-wide exclusions or conditions?",
    "What happens to the Hospital Cash benefit if the Maid’s hospital confinement exceeds the thirty consecutive days limit specified in the policy schedule?",
    "Does the Hospital Cash benefit cover hospital stays due to pre-existing conditions of the Maid, and how does this interact with any optional covers or exclusions?",
    "How is the Hospital Cash benefit affected if the Maid’s hospital confinement is due to a quarantine requirement related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases?",
    "If the Maid is admitted to the hospital but discharged and readmitted within a short period, how does the policy treat these confinements in relation to the consecutive days count for Hospital Cash?",
    "What are the implications if the Maid’s hospital confinement is due to an accident covered under a different section of the policy—does the Hospital Cash benefit under Section 2 still apply?",
    "How does the policy define a ‘day’ for the purpose of calculating the Hospital Cash benefit, and what happens if the Maid is admitted or discharged mid-day?",

    "How does the Hospital Cash benefit coordinate with other benefits or reimbursements the Maid might receive from the hospital or other insurance policies?",
    "What is the process and timeline for submitting a claim for the Hospital Cash benefit, and how do delays or incomplete documentation affect claim approval?",
    "If the Maid’s hospital confinement is related to a condition excluded under the policy’s general exclusions, does the Hospital Cash benefit still apply under this extension?",
    "How does the Hospital Cash benefit under this extension interact with any payment-before-cover warranties or sanctions/subrogation clauses in the overall policy?",
    "In the event of a dispute over the length of hospital confinement or eligibility for the Hospital Cash benefit, what evidence or reports does the insurer require to resolve the claim?",
    "Does the Hospital Cash benefit cover hospital stays in non-traditional or alternative medical facilities, or is it limited to recognized hospitals as defined by the policy?"
