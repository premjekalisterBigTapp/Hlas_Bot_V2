  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define the percentage of permanent disablement compensation for the loss of hearing in both ears compared to the loss of hearing in one ear, and how does this relate to the loss of speech?",
    "In cases of permanent disablement involving the loss of fingers, how are the compensation percentages differentiated between the loss of a thumb with two phalanges versus one phalanx, and how does this compare to the index finger with varying phalanges lost?",
    "What is the compensation percentage for permanent disablement due to the loss of all toes on one foot, and how does this compare to the loss of the great toe with either one or two phalanges lost?",
    "If a claimant suffers permanent disablement from the loss of four fingers on one hand, how does the policy quantify the compensation, and how does this differ from the loss of the thumb and four fingers of one hand?",
    "How does the policy handle compensation for permanent disablement involving the loss of the middle finger with three phalanges lost versus the ring finger with two phalanges lost, and what are the respective percentages?",
    "What are the compensation percentages for permanent disablement resulting from the loss of the little finger with one phalanx lost compared to the loss of any other toe, and how does the policy distinguish between these?",
    "How does the policy address permanent disablement claims for losses not explicitly listed in the scale of compensation, and what implications does this have for claimants with unusual injuries?",
    "In the event of permanent disablement involving the loss of speech, what percentage of compensation is provided, and how does this compare to the loss of hearing in one ear?",
    "How are partial losses of fingers compensated, for example, the index finger with two phalanges lost versus the thumb with one phalanx lost, and what documentation might be required to substantiate the extent of the injury?",
    "What is the compensation percentage for permanent disablement due to the loss of the ring finger with one phalanx lost, and how does this compare to the loss of the middle finger with one phalanx lost?",
    "How does the policy differentiate compensation between the loss of the great toe with two phalanges lost and the loss of any other toe, and what are the respective percentages?",
    "If a claimant loses hearing in one ear and also suffers the loss of the little finger with two phalanges lost, how would the policy calculate the combined permanent disablement compensation?",
    "What are the compensation percentages for permanent disablement involving the loss of the thumb and four fingers of one hand compared to the loss of four fingers of one hand only, and how might this affect claims involving multiple digit losses?",
    "How does the policy quantify permanent disablement compensation for the loss of the index finger with three phalanges lost, and how does this compare to the loss of the thumb with two phalanges lost?",
    "In cases where multiple fingers are partially lost, such as the middle finger with two phalanges lost and the ring finger with one phalanx lost, how does the policy determine the total compensation percentage?",
    "What is the compensation percentage for permanent disablement due to the loss of the little finger with three phalanges lost, and how does this compare to the loss of the ring finger with three phalanges lost?",
    "How does the policy address permanent disablement claims involving the loss of the thumb with two phalanges lost versus the loss of the index finger with one phalanx lost, and what are the respective compensation percentages?",
    "If a claimant suffers permanent disablement from the loss of the great toe with one phalanx lost and any other toe, how does the policy calculate the combined compensation percentage?",
    "What documentation and medical evidence might be necessary to prove the extent of permanent disablement for partial losses of fingers or toes as defined by the phalanges in the policy?",
    "How does the exclusion of any permanent disablement not listed in the scale of compensation affect claims for injuries such as partial nerve damage or loss of function without physical severance?"
