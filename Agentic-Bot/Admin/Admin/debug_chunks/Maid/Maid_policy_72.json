  "content": "For the above definition, the following are excluded:\n* All tumours which are histologically classified as any of the following:\n* Pre-malignant;\n* Non-invasive;\n* Carcinoma-in-situ;\n* Having borderline malignancy;\n* Having any degree of malignant potential;\n* Having suspicious malignancy;\n* Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behaviour; or\n* Cervical Dysplasia CIN-1, CIN-2 and CIN-3;\n* Any non-melanoma skin carcinoma unless there is evidence of metastases to lymph nodes or beyond;\n* Malignant melanoma that has not caused invasion beyond the epidermis;\n* All Prostate cancers histologically described as T1N0M0 (TNM Classification) or below; or Prostate cancers of another equivalent or lesser classification;\n* All Thyroid cancers histologically classified as T1N0M0 (TNM Classification) or below;\n* All tumours of the Urinary Bladder histologically classified as T1N0M0 (TNM Classification) or below;",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define exclusions related to tumours with borderline malignancy or suspicious malignancy, and what documentation is required to prove malignancy beyond these classifications?",
    "In cases of non-melanoma skin carcinoma, under what conditions would treatment be covered, and how does evidence of metastases to lymph nodes affect claim eligibility?",
    "What are the implications for claims involving malignant melanoma that has not invaded beyond the epidermis, and how does this exclusion interact with general cancer coverage?",
    "How are prostate cancers classified as T1N0M0 or below treated under the policy, and what equivalent or lesser classifications would also be excluded from coverage?",
    "For thyroid cancers classified as T1N0M0 or below, what are the coverage limitations, and how should insured individuals document the histological classification to support claims?",
    "How does the exclusion of urinary bladder tumours classified as T1N0M0 or below affect claims, and what is the significance of the TNM classification in determining coverage?",
    "What are the policy's requirements for histological classification in determining whether a tumour is excluded, and how might borderline or uncertain malignancy categories impact claim approval?",
    "In the context of cervical dysplasia, how do the exclusions of CIN-1, CIN-2, and CIN-3 affect coverage, and what evidence is necessary to differentiate between excluded and covered conditions?",
    "How does the policy handle claims involving neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behaviour, and what documentation or medical opinions are required to assess coverage eligibility?",
    "What is the role of histological evidence in distinguishing between pre-malignant and malignant tumours for coverage purposes, and how does this affect claims related to carcinoma-in-situ?",
    "How do the exclusions for tumours with any degree of malignant potential interact with general exclusions for pre-existing conditions or optional covers for cancer treatment?",
    "In cases where a tumour is initially classified as non-invasive but later shows invasive characteristics, how does the timing of diagnosis and treatment affect claim validity under the policy?",
    "What are the implications for insured persons who have tumours classified as carcinoma-in-situ in terms of coverage, and how does this relate to the policy's definitions of covered illnesses?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between tumours with borderline malignancy and those with suspicious malignancy, and what impact does this distinction have on claim outcomes?",
    "For tumours excluded due to being histologically pre-malignant, what are the policy's provisions regarding subsequent malignant transformation, and how should claims be handled in such scenarios?",
    "How do the exclusions related to specific TNM classifications for prostate, thyroid, and urinary bladder cancers affect insured persons undergoing routine screenings or early-stage diagnoses?",
    "What documentation is required to demonstrate that a non-melanoma skin carcinoma has metastasized beyond the lymph nodes to qualify for coverage under the policy?",
    "How does the policy address claims for tumours that are initially classified as neoplasm of uncertain behaviour but later confirmed malignant, especially regarding timing and coverage limits?",
    "In the event of a diagnosis of cervical dysplasia CIN-3, what are the coverage implications, and how does this exclusion interact with any optional cancer-related benefits?",
    "How do the policy's tumour exclusions interact with general exclusions related to pre-existing conditions, and what are the procedures for insured persons to declare or contest these exclusions?"
