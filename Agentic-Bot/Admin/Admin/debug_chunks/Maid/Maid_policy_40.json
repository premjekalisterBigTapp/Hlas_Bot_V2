  "content": "**\"Period of Insurance\"** means the period of cover as specified in the Policy Schedule during which the Policy is effective and has not been cancelled or otherwise terminated, excluding any period when Your Maid returns to her home country.\n\n**\"Permanent Disablement\"** means a disability falling under one of the items of disablement listed in the scale of compensation in this Policy under Benefit B, which was caused by an Accident, as long as the disability lasts for twelve (12) consecutive months from the date of the Accident and at the expiry of that period our appointed Registered Medical Practitioner confirms that the disability is not going to improve after twelve (12) months.",
