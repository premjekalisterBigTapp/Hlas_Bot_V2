  "content": "(a) war, invasion, acts of foreign enemies, hostilities or warlike operations (whether war be declared or not), civil war, mutiny, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, conspiracy, any foreseeable strikes, riots, civil commotion assuming the proportions of or amounting to an uprising, military or usurped power;\n    (b) any act of terrorism.\nFor the purpose of this endorsement an act of terrorism means an act, including but not limited to the use of force or violence and/or the threat thereof, of any person or group(s) of persons, whether acting alone or on behalf of or in connection with any organisation(s) or government(s), committed for political, religious, ideological or similar purposes including the intention to influence any government and/or to put the public, or any section of the public, in fear.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy define and exclude coverage for events related to war, invasion, and acts of foreign enemies, and how does this exclusion apply regardless of whether war is formally declared?",
    "In what ways are civil disturbances such as mutiny, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, and conspiracy excluded from coverage, and how does the policy treat foreseeable strikes and riots that escalate to uprisings?",
    "How does the exclusion of military or usurped power events interact with claims arising from civil commotion or civil war scenarios under this endorsement?",
    "What specific criteria must be met for an event to be classified as an act of terrorism under this endorsement, and how does this classification affect coverage eligibility?",
    "How does the policy distinguish between acts of terrorism committed by individuals acting alone versus those connected to organizations or governments, and what implications does this have for claim acceptance?",
    "In cases where an act of terrorism is motivated by political, religious, ideological, or similar purposes, how does the policy's terrorism exclusion apply, especially regarding the intent to influence governments or instill public fear?",
    "How are threats of violence or use of force considered under the terrorism exclusion, and does the mere threat without actual violence trigger the exclusion?",
    "If a claim arises from a riot or civil commotion that does not reach the scale of an uprising, how does the policy determine whether the war and civil disturbance exclusions apply?",
    "How does the exclusion for conspiracy affect claims related to coordinated acts of violence or terrorism, and what evidence is required to establish such a conspiracy under the policy terms?",
    "In scenarios involving mutiny or rebellion within a country, how does the policy's exclusion interact with coverage for losses caused by unrelated criminal acts during the same period?",
    "How does the policy treat claims arising from acts of terrorism that occur during a declared war versus those during peacetime, considering the overlapping exclusions?",
    "What is the impact of the war and terrorism exclusions on coverage for losses resulting from government-imposed travel restrictions or quarantines following such events?",
    "How does the policy address claims for damages caused by military or usurped power when such power is exercised by non-state actors or insurgent groups?",
    "In the event of a civil war or insurrection, how does the policy determine the applicability of exclusions if the insured is caught in a region not officially recognized as a conflict zone?",
    "How are foreseeable strikes excluded under this endorsement, and what distinguishes a foreseeable strike from an unforeseeable one in the context of coverage?",
    "How does the policy's exclusion for acts of terrorism apply to cyber-terrorism or non-physical acts intended to influence governments or public fear?",
    "What documentation or proof is required to demonstrate that a loss resulted from an excluded event such as war, terrorism, or civil commotion under this endorsement?",
    "How do the exclusions for warlike operations and acts of terrorism interact with other general policy exclusions, and which exclusion takes precedence in overlapping scenarios?",
    "If an insured experiences loss due to a riot that escalates into an uprising, how does the timing and scale of the event affect the applicability of the civil commotion and uprising exclusions?",
    "How does the policy define and exclude coverage for acts committed by usurped power, and what challenges might arise in proving such a status in claims involving political upheaval?"
