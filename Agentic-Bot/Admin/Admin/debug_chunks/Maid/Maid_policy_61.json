  "questions": [
    "How does the requirement of a Registered Medical Practitioner's hospitalisation leave certification affect the eligibility for reimbursement of alternative maid services under Section 5, and how does this interact with the necessity of a successful claim under Section 2 for Hospital and Surgical Expenses?",
    "What are the maximum duration and daily Benefit Limit constraints for claiming alternative maid services under Section 5, and how do these limits apply if the maid's hospitalisation extends beyond thirty days?",

    "In cases where the maid's hospitalization is due to an Injury sustained outside the Period of Insurance but the hospitalisation leave is issued during the Period of Insurance, how does the policy determine claim eligibility for alternative maid services?",
    "How does the policy define Permanent Disablement in the context of a maid's inability to perform usual duties, and what role does the Registered Medical Practitioner's certification play in establishing this condition for Replacement Maid Expenses?",
    "What documentation and proof are required to validate actual termination expenses and employment agency fees under Section 6, and how does the policy verify that these expenses are reasonable and directly related to the maid's Death or Permanent Disablement?",
    "If the maid's employment is terminated due to Permanent Disablement certified during the Period of Insurance, but the replacement maid is hired after the policy expires, does the policy cover the employment agency fees incurred post-policy period under Section 6?",
    "How do the Benefit Limits specified in the Policy Schedule apply cumulatively or separately to claims made under Section 5 for alternative maid services and Section 6 for replacement maid expenses?",

    "How does the policy address claims for alternative maid services if the maid is hospitalized but not issued hospitalisation leave by a Registered Medical Practitioner, and what impact does this have on claim approval under Section 5?",
    "What is the process for claiming reimbursement for alternative maid services when the policyholder incurs costs for services not directly replacing the maid's usual duties, and are such costs covered under Section 5?",
    "Under Section 6, how does the policy define and verify that the maid is medically unfit to perform usual duties, and what happens if the maid recovers partially but cannot resume full duties?",
    "How do the provisions in Sections 5 and 6 interact with any policy-wide requirements for timely claim notification and submission of medical certificates, especially regarding the maid's hospitalisation and permanent disablement?",
    "In the event of a claim under Section 6 for replacement maid expenses, how does the policy handle situations where the employment agency fees exceed the Benefit Limit, and are partial reimbursements allowed?"
