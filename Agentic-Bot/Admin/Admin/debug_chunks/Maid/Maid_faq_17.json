  "content": "Q: How does security bond works?\nA: HL Assurance will issue a Letter of Guarantee for the sum of $5,000 as a security bond on your behalf to the MOM. With this, you do not need to pay the $5,000 cash upfront to MOM when you are applying for a maid. If a demand is made by MOM, HL Assurance will make the payment first and recover it from you under the Counter Indemnity arrangement of the insurance. You may like to purchase the optional cover for a waiver of the Counter Indemnity in respect of the Letter of Guarantee to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), paying only $250 for the Excess for your account. By availing this option, you are relieved from the obligation of making an upfront payment of $5,000 in cash to the MOM while applying for a maid in Singapore.",
