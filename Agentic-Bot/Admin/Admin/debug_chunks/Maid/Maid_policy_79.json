  "content": "# GENERAL EXCLUSIONS\nWe will not pay compensation for\n1. any Death, disability, loss, damage, liability or expense directly or indirectly caused by or contributed to by or arising from nuclear weapons material or ionizing radiation or contamination by radioactivity from any nuclear fuel or from any nuclear waste from the combustion of nuclear fuel. For the purpose of this Exclusions, combustion shall include any self-sustaining process of nuclear fission.\n2. any Death, disability, loss, damage, destruction, legal liabilities, cost or expense including consequential loss of whatsoever nature, directly or indirectly caused by, resulting from or in connection with any of the following regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any other sequence to the loss:",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy address claims related to death or disability caused by nuclear weapons material or ionizing radiation, and what specific types of nuclear-related contamination are excluded?",
    "In what ways does the exclusion of losses arising from nuclear fuel combustion affect coverage for incidents involving nuclear waste, and how is 'combustion' defined in this context?",
    "How are consequential losses treated under the general exclusions when they are indirectly caused by nuclear radiation or contamination?",
    "What is the scope of legal liabilities excluded under the general exclusions related to nuclear materials, and how does this interact with other potential causes of loss?",
    "If a claim involves multiple causes including nuclear contamination and a covered peril, how does the policy determine coverage given the exclusion of losses 'regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any other sequence'?",
    "How does the policy differentiate between direct and indirect causes of loss in relation to nuclear-related exclusions, and what implications does this have for claimants?",
    "Are expenses related to cleanup or decontamination from nuclear fuel combustion covered or excluded under the general exclusions, and what documentation would be required to support such claims if covered?",
    "How does the exclusion of ionizing radiation-related losses interact with any optional covers or riders that might address radiation exposure?",
    "In the event of a loss involving radioactive contamination from nuclear waste, what timing or notification requirements must be met for a claim to be considered, given the general exclusions?",
    "How does the policy handle claims for disability resulting from exposure to nuclear weapons material during travel, especially if the exposure occurs in a country with known nuclear incidents?",
    "What are the implications of the general exclusions for claims involving legal liabilities arising from nuclear contamination, and how might this affect third-party claims?",
    "How does the policy treat losses caused by nuclear fission processes that are self-sustaining, and are there any exceptions or conditions under which such losses might be covered?",
    "In cases where nuclear contamination contributes indirectly to a loss that also involves a covered peril, how does the policy prioritize exclusions and coverage?",
    "How do the general exclusions related to nuclear materials affect claims for medical expenses incurred due to radiation sickness during or after travel?",
    "What documentation and proof are required to establish that a loss is excluded due to nuclear contamination under the policy's general exclusions?",
    "How does the exclusion of losses from nuclear weapons material impact claims related to terrorism or war events involving nuclear devices?",
    "Are there any age-related or trip-specific conditions that modify the application of the nuclear-related general exclusions?",
    "How do the general exclusions interact with any quarantine or COVID-19 related provisions if the illness is indirectly linked to radiation exposure?",
    "What is the policy's stance on subrogation or recovery rights in cases where a loss is excluded due to nuclear contamination but a third party may be liable?",
    "How does the policy define and apply the term 'contributed to by' in the context of nuclear-related exclusions, especially when multiple causes of loss are involved?"
