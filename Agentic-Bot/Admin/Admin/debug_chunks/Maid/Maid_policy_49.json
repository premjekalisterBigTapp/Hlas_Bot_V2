  "content": "We will not pay for any Permanent Disablement that is not listed in the scale of compensation above.\n\n### COMPENSATION LIMITS\nWe shall not pay for:\na. any specific item of Permanent Disablement where that item is also comprised in any other item of Permanent Disablement for which a greater amount of compensation is payable in the circumstances. If benefit is payable for loss of use of a whole member of the body, the benefit for parts of the member cannot also be claimed.\nb. Death in addition to any Permanent Disablement if caused by the same Accident, except that if a payment has been made under any part of Permanent Disablement and Death occurs subsequently solely caused by and twelve (12) months of the Accident, then We will pay any difference if the Compensation payable for Death is greater than that already paid for Permanent Disablement.\nc. more than 100% of the Benefit Limit in aggregate of all percentages payable under Permanent Disablement in any one Period of Insurance.",
  "questions": [
    "How does the policy handle compensation when multiple Permanent Disablement items overlap, such as when loss of use of a whole body member and its parts are both involved, and what are the implications for claim limits?",
    "In the event that an Accident causes both Permanent Disablement and Death, under what conditions will the policy pay Death benefits in addition to Permanent Disablement benefits, and how is the timing of Death relevant?",
    "What is the maximum aggregate compensation payable under the Permanent Disablement section within a single Period of Insurance, and how does this limit affect multiple claims arising from the same Accident?",
    "If a claimant suffers Permanent Disablement not explicitly listed in the scale of compensation, how does the policy address eligibility and payment for such disablements?",
    "How does the policy determine compensation when a claimant experiences loss of use of a whole member versus loss of parts of that member, and what restrictions apply to claiming both?",
    "When Death occurs within twelve months after an Accident for which Permanent Disablement compensation was already paid, how is the difference in compensation calculated and paid?",
    "Can a claimant receive compensation for both Death and Permanent Disablement caused by the same Accident if the Death occurs after the Permanent Disablement payment, and what documentation or proof might be required to establish causation and timing?",
    "How does the policy prevent double compensation for overlapping Permanent Disablement items, and what examples illustrate this exclusion in practice?",
    "What happens if the total percentage compensation for multiple Permanent Disablement items exceeds 100% of the Benefit Limit, and how is the final payout adjusted?",
    "Are there any exceptions to the exclusion of Permanent Disablement items not listed in the scale of compensation, such as for rare or unusual injuries, and how would these be handled?",
    "In cases where Permanent Disablement compensation has been partially paid and Death occurs later, how does the policy ensure that the total compensation does not exceed the Death benefit amount?",
    "How does the policy define the 'Period of Insurance' in relation to the 100% aggregate compensation limit for Permanent Disablement, and what happens if multiple Accidents occur within this period?",
    "If a claimant suffers multiple Permanent Disablement injuries from a single Accident affecting different body parts, how does the policy prioritize which items to compensate and how to apply the compensation limits?",
    "How does the policy address claims where the Permanent Disablement involves both physical loss and functional loss of body parts, and are these treated differently under the compensation scale?",
    "What documentation or medical evidence is typically required to support claims for Permanent Disablement under this policy, especially when distinguishing between whole member loss and part loss?",
    "How does the policy handle situations where Death and Permanent Disablement claims arise from the same Accident but the Death is due to a different cause within the twelve-month window?",
    "In the event of a claim for Permanent Disablement, how does the policy ensure that compensation is not duplicated for items that are subsets of a larger body member already compensated?",
    "What are the implications for claimants if the Accident results in Permanent Disablement items that collectively exceed the Benefit Limit, and how does the policy calculate the proportional payments?",
    "How does the policy's exclusion of unlisted Permanent Disablement items interact with any general exclusions or optional covers that might apply to unusual injuries?",
    "If a claimant receives compensation for Permanent Disablement and subsequently dies from the same Accident after twelve months, does the policy provide any additional Death benefit, and how is this time frame critical?"
