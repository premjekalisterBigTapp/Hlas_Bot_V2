Fixing Run Error




Errors Encountered
1. Port 8000 Already in Use (Error 10048)
ERROR: [Errno 10048] error while attempting to bind on address ('0.0.0.0', 8000): only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted
What this means: Another instance of the application was already running and listening on port 8000, preventing the new instance from starting.
How I fixed it:
Ran netstat -ano | findstr :8000 to identify which process was using port 8000
Found that process ID (PID) 32512 was occupying the port
Killed that process using: taskkill /PID 32512 /F
2. Redis Connection Refused (Error 10061)
RuntimeError: Failed to connect to Redis at redis://localhost:6379/0ConnectionRefusedError: [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it
What this means: The application requires Redis to be running on localhost:6379, but Redis wasn't running. The chatbot uses Redis for:
Session management (storing conversation state)
Rate limiting
Caching
How I fixed it:
Checked the docker-compose.yml file and found it defines Redis, MongoDB, and Weaviate services
Started Docker Desktop: Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"
Waited for Docker to initialize (15 seconds)
Verified all containers were running with docker ps, which showed:
hlas-redis (Redis on port 6379)
hlas-mongodb (MongoDB on port 27017)
hlas-weaviate (Weaviate on port 8080)
Final Solution
After fixing both issues, I started the chatbot with:
cd "D:\PremJeKalister\Projects_Official\Project_15C (Hlas_Phase3_C)\Agentic-Bot"& "d:/PremJeKalister/Projects_Official/Project_15C (Hlas_Phase3_C)/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1"python main.py
The application successfully initialized all components:
✅ Redis connection established
✅ Session manager initialized
✅ Azure LLM models (GPT-4.1-mini) loaded
✅ Weaviate vector store connected
✅ Server started on http://0.0.0.0:8000
Root Cause: Docker Desktop wasn't running, which meant none of the required infrastructure services (Redis, MongoDB, Weaviate) were available.
